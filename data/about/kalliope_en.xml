    <i>Kalliope</i> is a database containing old Danish poetry and associated biographical data. The goal is no less than to collect all of the older Danish poetry, but until then, Kalliope will contain a representative and still growing selection. Kalliope also contains poetry in English and other languages, but primarily as reference material to the Danish collection.

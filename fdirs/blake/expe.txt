T:Introduction
F:Piping down the valleys wild

     Piping down the valleys wild,
     Piping songs of pleasant glee,
     On a cloud I saw a child,
     And he laughing said to me:

     `Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
     So I piped with merry cheer.
     `Piper, pipe that song again;'
     So I piped: he wept to hear.

     `Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
     Sing thy songs of happy cheer:'
     So I sang the same again,
     While he wept with joy to hear.

     `Piper, sit thee down and write
     In a book, that all may read.'
     So he vanish'd from my sight,
     And I pluck'd a hollow reed,

     And I made a rural pen,
     And I stain'd the water clear,
     And I wrote my happy songs
     Every child may joy to hear.

T:The Echoing Green
F:The Sun does arise

     The Sun does arise,
     And make happy the skies;
     The merry bells ring
     To welcome the Spring;
     The skylark and thrush,
     The birds of the bush,
     Sing louder around
     To the bells' cheerful sound,
     While our sports shall be seen
     On the Echoing Green.

     Old John, with white hair,
     Does laugh away care,
     Sitting under the oak,
     Among the old folk.
     They laugh at our play,
     And soon they all say:
     `Such, such were the joys
     When we all, girls and boys,
     In our youth time were seen
     On the Echoing Green.'

     Till the little ones, weary,
     No more can be merry;
     The sun does descend,
     And our sports have an end.
     Round the laps of their mothers
     Many sisters and brothers,
     Like birds in their nest,
     Are ready for rest,
     And sport no more seen
     On the darkening Green.

T:The Lamb
F:Little Lamb, who made thee?
                                              
     Little Lamb, who made thee?
     Dost thou know who made thee?
     Gave thee life, and bid thee feed,
     By the stream and o'er the mead;
     Gave thee clothing of delight,
     Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
     Gave thee such a tender voice,
     Making all the vales rejoice?
     Little Lamb, who made thee?
     Dost thou know who made thee?
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:
     He is callèd by thy name,
     For He calls Himself a Lamb.
     He is meek, and He is mild;
     He became a little child.
     I a child, and thou a lamb,
     We are callèd by His name.
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!

T:The Shepherd
F:How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!
                                            

     How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!
     From the morn to the evening he strays;
     He shall follow his sheep all the day,
     And his tongue shall be fillèd with praise.

     For he hears the lamb's innocent call,
     And he hears the ewe's tender reply;
     He is watchful while they are in peace,
     For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.

F:I have no name
                
         `I have no name:
         I am but two days old.'
         What shall I call thee?
         `I happy am,
         Joy is my name.'
         Sweet joy befall thee!

         Pretty Joy!
         Sweet Joy, but two days old.
         Sweet Joy I call thee
         Thou dost smile,
         I sing the while,
         Sweet joy befall thee!

T:The Little Black Boy
F:My mother bore me in the southern wild

     My mother bore me in the southern wild,
     And I am black, but O! my soul is white;
     White as an angel is the English child,
     But I am black, as if bereav'd of light.

     My mother taught me underneath a tree,
     And, sitting down before the heat of day,
     She took me on her lap and kissèd me,
     And, pointing to the east, began to say:

     `Look on the rising sun, -- there God does live,
     And gives His light, and gives His heat away;
     And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
     Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

     `And we are put on earth a little space,
     That we may learn to bear the beams of love;
     And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
     Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove, 
     `For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
     The cloud will vanish; we shall hear His voice,
     Saying: "Come out from the grove, My love and care,
     And round My golden tent like lambs rejoice."'

     Thus did my mother say, and kissèd me;
     And thus I say to little English boy.
     When I from black and he from white cloud free,
     And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,

     I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear
     To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
     And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
     And be like him, and he will then love me.

T:Laughing Song
F:When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy

     When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
     And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
     When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
     And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;

     When the meadows laugh with lively green,
     And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
     When Mary and Susan and Emily
     With their sweet round mouths sing `Ha, Ha, He!'

     When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
     Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread,
     Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
     To sing the sweet chorus of `Ha, Ha, He!'

F:Sound the flute!
        
         Sound the flute!
         Now it's mute.
         Birds delight
         Day and night;
         Nightingale
         In the dale,
         Lark in sky,
         Merrily,

Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.

     Little boy,
     Full of joy;
     Little girl,
     Sweet and small;
     Cock does crow,
     So do you;
     Merry voice,
     Infant noise,

Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.

     Little lamb,
     Here I am;
     Come and lick
     My white neck;
     Let me pull
     Your soft wool;
     Let me kiss
     Your soft face:

Merrily, merrily, we welcome in the year.

T:A Cradle Song
F:Sweet dreams, form a shade

         Sweet dreams, form a shade
         O'er my lovely infant's head;
         Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
         By happy, silent, moony beams.

         Sweet sleep, with soft down
         Weave thy brows an infant crown.
         Sweet sleep, Angel mild,
         Hover o'er my happy child.

         Sweet smiles, in the night
         Hover over my delight;
         Sweet smiles, mother's smiles,
         All the livelong night beguiles.

         Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
         Chase not slumber from thy eyes.
         Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,
         All the dovelike moans beguiles.

         Sleep, sleep, happy child,
         All creation slept and smil'd;
         Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
         While o'er thee thy mother weep.

         Sweet babe, in thy face
         Holy image I can trace.
         Sweet babe, once like thee,
         Thy Maker lay and wept for me,

         Wept for me, for thee, for all,
         When He was an infant small.
         Thou His image ever see,
         Heavenly face that smiles on thee

         Smiles on thee, on me, on all;
         Who became an infant small.
         Infant smiles are His own smiles;
         Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.

T:Nurse's Song
F:When the voices of children are heard on the green

When the voices of children are heard on the green,
And laughing is heard on the hill,
My heart is at rest within my breast,
And everything else is still.

`Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
And the dews of night arise;
Come, come leave off play, and let us away
Till the morning appears in the skies.'

`No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
And we cannot go to sleep;
Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
And the hills are all cover'd with sheep.'

`Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,
And then go home to bed.'
The little ones leapèd and shoutèd and laugh'd
And all the hills echoèd.

T:Holy Thursday
F:Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean

     'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
     The children walking two and two, in red and blue and green,
     Grey-headed beadles walk'd before, with wands as white as snow,
     Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames' waters flow.

     O what a multitude they seem'd, these flowers of London town!
     Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own.
     The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
     Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.

     Now like a mighty wind they raise to Heaven the voice of song,
     Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of Heaven among.
     Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;
     Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.

         Merry, merry sparrow!
         Under leaves so green,
         A happy blossom
         Sees you, swift as arrow,
         Seek your cradle narrow
         Near my bosom.

         Pretty, pretty robin!
         Under leaves so green,
         A happy blossom
         Hears you sobbing, sobbing,
         Pretty, pretty robin,
         Near my bosom.

T:The Chimney Sweeper
F:When my mother died I was very young

     When my mother died I was very young,
     And my father sold me while yet my tongue
     Could scarcely cry `'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!'
     So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.

     There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
     That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said
     `Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare
     You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.'

     And so he was quiet, and that very night,
     As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--
     That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
     Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black.

     And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
     And he open'd the coffins and set them all free;
     Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,
     And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.

     Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
     They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;
     And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
     He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.

     And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark,
     And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
     Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm;
     So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.

T:The Divine Image
F:To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love

     To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
     All pray in their distress;
     And to these virtues of delight
     Return their thankfulness.

     For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
     Is God, our Father dear,
     And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
     Is man, His child and care.

     For Mercy has a human heart,
     Pity a human face,
     And Love, the human form divine,
     And Peace, the human dress.

     Then every man, of every clime,
     That prays in his distress,
     Prays to the human form divine,
     Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.

     And all must love the human form,
     In heathen, Turk, or Jew;
     Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell
     There God is dwelling too.

T:Night
F:The sun descending in the west

     The sun descending in the west,
     The evening star does shine;
     The birds are silent in their nest,
     And I must seek for mine.
     The moon, like a flower,
     In heaven's high bower,
     With silent delight
     Sits and smiles on the night.

     Farewell, green fields and happy groves,
     Where flocks have took delight.
     Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
     The feet of angels bright;
     Unseen they pour blessing,
     And joy without ceasing,
     On each bud and blossom,
     And each sleeping bosom.

     They look in every thoughtless nest,
     Where birds are cover'd warm;
     They visit caves of every beast,
     To keep them all from harm.
     If they see any weeping
     That should have been sleeping,
     They pour sleep on their head,
     And sit down by their bed.

     When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
     They pitying stand and weep;
     Seeking to drive their thirst away,
     And keep them from the sheep.
     But if they rush dreadful,
     The angels, most heedful,
     Receive each mild spirit,
     New worlds to inherit.

     And there the lion's ruddy eyes
     Shall flow with tears of gold,
     And pitying the tender cries,
     And walking round the fold,
     Saying `Wrath, by His meekness,
     And, by His health, sickness
     Is driven away
     From our immortal day.

     `And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
     I can lie down and sleep;
     Or think on Him who bore thy name,
     Graze after thee and weep.
     For, wash'd in life's river.
     My bright mane for ever
     Shall shine like the gold
     As I guard o'er the fold.'

     Once a dream did weave a shade
     O'er my Angel-guarded bed,
     That an emmet lost its way
     Where on grass methought I lay.

     Troubled, 'wilder'd, and forlorn,
     Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
     Over many a tangled spray,
     All heart-broke I heard her say:

     `O, my children! do they cry?
     Do they hear their father sigh?
     Now they look abroad to see:
     Now return and weep for me.'

     Pitying, I dropp'd a tear;
     But I saw a glow-worm near,
     Who replied: `What wailing wight
     Calls the watchman of the night?

     `I am set to light the ground,
     While the beetle goes his round:
     Follow now the beetle's hum;
     Little wanderer, hie thee home.'

         Can I see another's woe,
         And not be in sorrow too?
         Can I see another's grief,
         And not seek for kind relief?

         Can I see a falling tear,
         And not feel my sorrow's share?
         Can a father see his child
         Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd?

         Can a mother sit and hear
         An infant groan, an infant fear?
         No, no! never can it be!
         Never, never can it be!

         And can He who smiles on all
         Hear the wren with sorrows small,
         Hear the small bird's grief and care,
         Hear the woes that infants bear,

         And not sit beside the nest,
         Pouring pity in their breast;
         And not sit the cradle near,
         Weeping tear on infant's tear;

         And not sit both night and day,
         Wiping all our tears away?
         O, no! never can it be!
         Never, never can it be!

         He doth give His joy to all;
         He becomes an infant small;
         He becomes a man of woe;
         He doth feel the sorrow too.

         Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
         And thy Maker is not by;
         Think not thou canst weep a tear,
         And thy Maker is not near.

         O! He gives to us His joy
         That our grief He may destroy;
         Till our grief is fled and gone
         He doth sit by us and moan.

     If her mother weep?

     `If her heart does ache
     Then let Lyca wake;
     If my mother sleep,
     Lyca shall not weep.

     `Frowning, frowning night,
     O'er this desert bright,
     Let thy moon arise
     While I close my eyes.'

     Sleeping Lyca lay
     While the beasts of prey,
     Come from caverns deep,
     View'd the maid asleep.

     The kingly lion stood,
     And the virgin view'd,
     Then he gamboll'd round
     O'er the hallow'd ground.

     Leopards, tigers, play
     Round her as she lay,
     While the lion old
     Bow'd his mane of gold

     And her bosom lick,
     And upon her neck
     From his eyes of flame
     Ruby tears there came;

     While the lioness
     Loos'd her slender dress,
     And naked they convey'd
     To caves the sleeping maid.

F:All the night in woe

     All the night in woe
     Lyca's parents go
     Over valleys deep,
     While the deserts weep.

     Tired and woe-begone,
     Hoarse with making moan,
     Arm in arm seven days
     They trac'd the desert ways.

     Seven nights they sleep
     Among shadows deep,
     And dream they see their child
     Starv'd in desert wild.

     Pale, thro' pathless ways
     The fancied image strays
     Famish'd, weeping, weak,
     With hollow piteous shriek.

     Rising from unrest,
     The trembling woman prest
     With feet of weary woe:
     She could no further go.

     In his arms he bore
     Her, arm'd with sorrow sore;
     Till before their way
     A couching lion lay.

     Turning back was vain:
     Soon his heavy mane
     Bore them to the ground.
     Then he stalk'd around,

     Smelling to his prey;
     But their fears allay
     When he licks their hands,
     And silent by them stands.

     They look upon his eyes
     Fill'd with deep surprise;
     And wondering behold
     A spirit arm'd in gold.

     On his head a crown;
     On his shoulders down
     Flow'd his golden hair.
     Gone was all their care.

     `Follow me,' he said;
     `Weep not for the maid;
     In my palace deep
     Lyca lies asleep.'

     Then they followèd
     Where the vision led,
     And saw their sleeping child
     Among tigers wild.

     To this day they dwell
     In a lonely dell;
     Nor fear the wolfish howl
     Nor the lions' growl.

F:Love seeketh not itself to please

`Love seeketh not itself to please,
Nor for itself hath any care,
But for another gives its ease,
And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair.'

So sung a little Clod of Clay,
Trodden with the cattle's feet,
But a Pebble of the brook
Warbled out these metres meet:

`Love seeketh only Self to please,
To bind another to its delight,
Joys in another's loss of ease,
And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.'

F:But the Ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm

But the Ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;
Besides I can tell where I am used well,
Such usage in Heaven will never do well.

But if at the Church they would give us some ale,
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
We'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day,
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.

Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.

And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
His children as pleasant and happy as He,
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.

     Can it be a song of joy?
     And so many children poor?
     It is a land of poverty!

     And their sun does never shine,
     And their fields are bleak and bare,
     And their ways are fill'd with thorns:
     It is eternal winter there.

     For where'er the sun does shine,

Blow'd in the morn; in evening died;

With cruelty didst mould my heart,

Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears;

Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
And me to mortal life betray:

Dark disputes and artful teasing.

And feel they know not what but care,
And wish to lead others, when they should be led.

     O! what sweet company.

     But to go to school in a summer morn,
     O! it drives all joy away;
     Under a cruel eye outworn,
     The little ones spend the day
     In sighing and dismay.

     Ah! then at times I drooping sit,
     And spend many an anxious hour,
     Nor in my book can I take delight,
     Nor sit in learning's bower,
     Worn thro' with the dreary shower.

     How can the bird that is born for joy
     Sit in a cage and sing?
     How can a child, when fears annoy,
     But droop his tender wing,
     And forget his youthful spring?

     And blossoms blown away,

     When the blasts of winter appear?

     Fill'd with softest care,
     Met in garden bright

     Waves o'er heaven's deep,

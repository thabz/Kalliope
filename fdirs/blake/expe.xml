<body>
     Piping down the valleys wild,
     Piping songs of pleasant glee,
     On a cloud I saw a child,
     And he laughing said to me:

     `Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
     So I piped with merry cheer.
     `Piper, pipe that song again;'
     So I piped: he wept to hear.

     `Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
     Sing thy songs of happy cheer:'
     So I sang the same again,
     While he wept with joy to hear.

     `Piper, sit thee down and write
     In a book, that all may read.'
     So he vanish'd from my sight,
     And I pluck'd a hollow reed,

     And I made a rural pen,
     And I stain'd the water clear,
     And I wrote my happy songs
     Every child may joy to hear.

     The Sun does arise,
     And make happy the skies;
     The merry bells ring
     To welcome the Spring;
     The skylark and thrush,
     The birds of the bush,
     Sing louder around
     To the bells' cheerful sound,
     While our sports shall be seen
     On the Echoing Green.

     Old John, with white hair,
     Does laugh away care,
     Sitting under the oak,
     Among the old folk.
     They laugh at our play,
     And soon they all say:
     `Such, such were the joys
     When we all, girls and boys,
     In our youth time were seen
     On the Echoing Green.'

     Till the little ones, weary,
     No more can be merry;
     The sun does descend,
     And our sports have an end.
     Round the laps of their mothers
     Many sisters and brothers,
     Like birds in their nest,
     Are ready for rest,
     And sport no more seen
     On the darkening Green.

     Gave thee life, and bid thee feed,
     By the stream and o'er the mead;
     Gave thee clothing of delight,
     Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
     Gave thee such a tender voice,
     Making all the vales rejoice?
     Little Lamb, who made thee?
     Dost thou know who made thee?
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:
     He is callèd by thy name,
     For He calls Himself a Lamb.
     He is meek, and He is mild;
     He became a little child.
     I a child, and thou a lamb,
     We are callèd by His name.

     And his tongue shall be fillèd with praise.

     For he hears the lamb's innocent call,
     And he hears the ewe's tender reply;
     He is watchful while they are in peace,
     For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.

<body>
My mother bore me in the southern wild,
And I am black, but O! my soul is white;
White as an angel is the English child,
But I am black, as if bereav'd of light.

My mother taught me underneath a tree,
And, sitting down before the heat of day,
She took me on her lap and kissèd me,
And, pointing to the east, began to say:

`Look on the rising sun, - there God does live,
And gives His light, and gives His heat away;
And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

`And we are put on earth a little space,
That we may learn to bear the beams of love;
And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove,

`For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
The cloud will vanish; we shall hear His voice,
Saying: "Come out from the grove, My love and care,
And round My golden tent like lambs rejoice."'

Thus did my mother say, and kissèd me;
And thus I say to little English boy.
When I from black and he from white cloud free,
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,

I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear
To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
And be like him, and he will then love me.

     When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
     And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
     When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
     And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;

     When the meadows laugh with lively green,
     And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
     When Mary and Susan and Emily
     With their sweet round mouths sing `Ha, Ha, He!'

     When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
     Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread,
     Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
     To sing the sweet chorus of `Ha, Ha, He!'

         Sweet dreams, form a shade
         O'er my lovely infant's head;
         Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
         By happy, silent, moony beams.

         Sweet sleep, with soft down
         Weave thy brows an infant crown.
         Sweet sleep, Angel mild,
         Hover o'er my happy child.

         Sweet smiles, in the night
         Hover over my delight;
         Sweet smiles, mother's smiles,
         All the livelong night beguiles.

         Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
         Chase not slumber from thy eyes.
         Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,
         All the dovelike moans beguiles.

         Sleep, sleep, happy child,
         All creation slept and smil'd;
         Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
         While o'er thee thy mother weep.

         Sweet babe, in thy face
         Holy image I can trace.
         Sweet babe, once like thee,
         Thy Maker lay and wept for me,

         Wept for me, for thee, for all,
         When He was an infant small.
         Thou His image ever see,
         Heavenly face that smiles on thee

         Smiles on thee, on me, on all;
         Who became an infant small.
         Infant smiles are His own smiles;
         Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.

When the voices of children are heard on the green,
And laughing is heard on the hill,
My heart is at rest within my breast,
And everything else is still.

`Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
And the dews of night arise;
Come, come leave off play, and let us away
Till the morning appears in the skies.'

`No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
And we cannot go to sleep;
Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
And the hills are all cover'd with sheep.'

`Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,
And then go home to bed.'
The little ones leapèd and shoutèd and laugh'd
And all the hills echoèd.

     'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
     The children walking two and two, in red and blue and green,
     Grey-headed beadles walk'd before, with wands as white as snow,
     Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames' waters flow.

     O what a multitude they seem'd, these flowers of London town!
     Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own.
     The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
     Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.

     Now like a mighty wind they raise to Heaven the voice of song,
     Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of Heaven among.
     Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;
     Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.

     When my mother died I was very young,
     And my father sold me while yet my tongue
     Could scarcely cry `'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!'
     So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.

     There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
     That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said
     `Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare
     You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.'

     And so he was quiet, and that very night,
     As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--
     That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
     Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black.

     And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
     And he open'd the coffins and set them all free;
     Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,
     And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.

     Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
     They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;
     And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
     He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.

     And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark,
     And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
     Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm;
     So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.

     Pity a human face,
     And Love, the human form divine,
     And Peace, the human dress.

     Then every man, of every clime,

     The sun descending in the west,
     The evening star does shine;
     The birds are silent in their nest,
     And I must seek for mine.
     The moon, like a flower,
     In heaven's high bower,
     With silent delight
     Sits and smiles on the night.

     Farewell, green fields and happy groves,
     Where flocks have took delight.
     Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
     The feet of angels bright;
     Unseen they pour blessing,
     And joy without ceasing,
     On each bud and blossom,
     And each sleeping bosom.

     They look in every thoughtless nest,
     Where birds are cover'd warm;
     They visit caves of every beast,
     To keep them all from harm.
     If they see any weeping
     That should have been sleeping,
     They pour sleep on their head,
     And sit down by their bed.

     When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
     They pitying stand and weep;
     Seeking to drive their thirst away,
     And keep them from the sheep.
     But if they rush dreadful,
     The angels, most heedful,
     Receive each mild spirit,
     New worlds to inherit.

     And there the lion's ruddy eyes
     Shall flow with tears of gold,
     And pitying the tender cries,
     And walking round the fold,
     Saying `Wrath, by His meekness,
     And, by His health, sickness
     Is driven away
     From our immortal day.

     `And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
     I can lie down and sleep;
     Or think on Him who bore thy name,
     Graze after thee and weep.
     For, wash'd in life's river.
     My bright mane for ever
     Shall shine like the gold
     As I guard o'er the fold.'

     Once a dream did weave a shade
     O'er my Angel-guarded bed,
     That an emmet lost its way
     Where on grass methought I lay.

     Troubled, 'wilder'd, and forlorn,
     Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
     Over many a tangled spray,
     All heart-broke I heard her say:

     `O, my children! do they cry?
     Do they hear their father sigh?
     Now they look abroad to see:
     Now return and weep for me.'

     Pitying, I dropp'd a tear;
     But I saw a glow-worm near,
     Who replied: `What wailing wight
     Calls the watchman of the night?

     `I am set to light the ground,
     While the beetle goes his round:
     Follow now the beetle's hum;

         He becomes an infant small;
         He becomes a man of woe;
         He doth feel the sorrow too.

         Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
         And thy Maker is not by;
         Think not thou canst weep a tear,
         And thy Maker is not near.

         O! He gives to us His joy
         That our grief He may destroy;

     Hear the voice of the Bard!
     Who present, past, and future, sees;
     Whose ears have heard
     The Holy Word
     That walk'd among the ancient trees,

     Calling the lapsèd soul,
     And weeping in the evening dew;
     That might control
     The starry pole,
     And fallen, fallen light renew!

     `O Earth, O Earth, return!
     Arise from out the dewy grass;
     Night is worn,
     And the morn
     Rises from the slumberous mass.

     `Turn away no more;
     Why wilt thou turn away.
     The starry floor,
     The wat'ry shore,
     Is giv'n thee till the break of day.'

     Earth rais'd up her head
     From the darkness dread and drear.
     Her light fled,
     Stony dread!
     And her locks cover'd with grey despair.

     `Prison'd on wat'ry shore,
     Starry Jealousy does keep my den:
     Cold and hoar,
     Weeping o'er,
     I hear the Father of the Ancient Men.

     `Selfish Father of Men!
     Cruel, jealous, selfish Fear!
     Can delight,
     Chain'd in night,
     The virgins of youth and morning bear?

     `Does spring hide its joy
     When buds and blossoms grow?
     Does the sower
     Sow by night,
     Or the ploughman in darkness plough?

     `Break this heavy chain
     That does freeze my bones around.
     Selfish! vain!
     Eternal bane!
     That free Love with bondage bound.'

     When the voices of children are heard on the green
     And whisp'rings are in the dale,
     The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
     My face turns green and pale.

     Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
     And the dews of night arise;
     Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
     And your winter and night in disguise.

Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears,
And water'd heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye,

     In futurity
     I prophetic see
     That the earth from sleep
     (Grave the sentence deep)

     Shall arise and seek
     For her Maker meek;
     And the desert wild
     Become a garden mild.

     In the southern clime,
     Where the summer's prime
     Never fades away,
     Lovely Lyca lay.

     Seven summers old
     Lovely Lyca told;
     She had wander'd long
     Hearing wild birds' song.

     `Sweet sleep, come to me
     Underneath this tree.
     Do father, mother, weep?
     Where can Lyca sleep?

     `Lost in desert wild
     Is your little child.
     How can Lyca sleep
     If her mother weep?

     `If her heart does ache
     Then let Lyca wake;
     If my mother sleep,
     Lyca shall not weep.

     `Frowning, frowning night,
     O'er this desert bright,
     Let thy moon arise
     While I close my eyes.'

     Sleeping Lyca lay
     While the beasts of prey,
     Come from caverns deep,
     View'd the maid asleep.

     The kingly lion stood,
     And the virgin view'd,
     Then he gamboll'd round
     O'er the hallow'd ground.

     Leopards, tigers, play
     Round her as she lay,
     While the lion old
     Bow'd his mane of gold

     And her bosom lick,
     And upon her neck
     From his eyes of flame
     Ruby tears there came;

     While the lioness
     Loos'd her slender dress,
     And naked they convey'd
     To caves the sleeping maid.

<body>
     All the night in woe
     Lyca's parents go
     Over valleys deep,
     While the deserts weep.

     Tired and woe-begone,
     Hoarse with making moan,
     Arm in arm seven days
     They trac'd the desert ways.

     Seven nights they sleep
     Among shadows deep,
     And dream they see their child
     Starv'd in desert wild.

     Pale, thro' pathless ways
     The fancied image strays
     Famish'd, weeping, weak,
     With hollow piteous shriek.

     Rising from unrest,
     The trembling woman prest
     With feet of weary woe:
     She could no further go.

     In his arms he bore
     Her, arm'd with sorrow sore;
     Till before their way
     A couching lion lay.

     Turning back was vain:
     Soon his heavy mane
     Bore them to the ground.
     Then he stalk'd around,

     Smelling to his prey;
     But their fears allay
     When he licks their hands,
     And silent by them stands.

     They look upon his eyes
     Fill'd with deep surprise;
     And wondering behold
     A spirit arm'd in gold.

     On his head a crown;
     On his shoulders down
     Flow'd his golden hair.
     Gone was all their care.

     `Follow me,' he said;
     `Weep not for the maid;
     In my palace deep
     Lyca lies asleep.'

     Then they followèd
     Where the vision led,
     And saw their sleeping child
     Among tigers wild.

     To this day they dwell
     In a lonely dell;
     Nor fear the wolfish howl
     Nor the lions' growl.

`Love seeketh not itself to please,

So sung a little Clod of Clay,

But a Pebble of the brook

`Love seeketh only Self to please,
To bind another to its delight,
Joys in another's loss of ease,
And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.'

<body>
But the Ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;
Besides I can tell where I am used well,
Such usage in Heaven will never do well.

But if at the Church they would give us some ale,
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
We'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day,
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.

Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.

And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
His children as pleasant and happy as He,
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.

     Is this a holy thing to see
     In a rich and fruitful land,
     Babes reduc'd to misery,
     Fed with cold and usurous hand?

     Is that trembling cry a song?
     Can it be a song of joy?
     And so many children poor?
     It is a land of poverty!

     And their sun does never shine,
     And their fields are bleak and bare,
     And their ways are fill'd with thorns:
     It is eternal winter there.

     For where'er the sun does shine,
     And where'er the rain does fall,
     Babe can never hunger there,
     Nor poverty the mind appal.

I was angry with my friend:

I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I water'd it in fears,
Night and morning with my tears;
And I sunnèd it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright;
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,

And into my garden stole
When the night had veil'd the pole:
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretch'd beneath the tree.

     And I wept both night and day,

     And I wept both day and night,
     And hid from him my heart's delight.

     So he took his wings and fled;
     Then the morn blush'd rosy red;
     I dried my tears, and arm'd my fears
     With ten thousand shields and spears.

     Soon my Angel came again:

Blow'd in the morn; in evening died;
But Mercy chang'd death into sleep;
The sexes rose to work and weep.

Thou, Mother of my mortal part,
With cruelty didst mould my heart,
And with false self-deceiving tears
Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears;

Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
And me to mortal life betray:
The death of Jesus set me free:
Then what have I to do with thee?

     I love to rise in a summer morn
     When the birds sing on every tree;
     The distant huntsman winds his horn,
     And the skylark sings with me.
     O! what sweet company.

     But to go to school in a summer morn,
     O! it drives all joy away;
     Under a cruel eye outworn,
     The little ones spend the day
     In sighing and dismay.

     Ah! then at times I drooping sit,
     And spend many an anxious hour,
     Nor in my book can I take delight,
     Nor sit in learning's bower,
     Worn thro' with the dreary shower.

     How can the bird that is born for joy
     Sit in a cage and sing?
     How can a child, when fears annoy,
     But droop his tender wing,
     And forget his youthful spring?

     O! father and mother, if buds are nipp'd
     And blossoms blown away,
     And if the tender plants are stripp'd
     Of their joy in the springing day,
     By sorrow and care's dismay,

     How shall the summer arise in joy,
     Or the summer fruits appear?
     Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
     Or bless the mellowing year,
     When the blasts of winter appear?

     In every cry of every Man,
     In every Infant's cry of fear,
     In every voice, in every ban,
     The mind-forg'd manacles I hear.

     How the chimney-sweeper's cry
     Every black'ning church appals;
     And the hapless soldier's sigh
     Runs in blood down palace walls.

     But most thro' midnight streets I hear
     How the youthful harlot's curse
     Blasts the new-born infant's tear,
     And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.

     Children of the future age,
     Reading this indignant page,
     Know that in a former time,
     Love, sweet Love, was thought a crime!

     In the Age of Gold,
     Free from winter's cold,
     Youth and maiden bright
     To the holy light,
     Naked in the sunny beams delight.

     Once a youthful pair,
     Fill'd with softest care,
     Met in garden bright
     Where the holy light
     Had just remov'd the curtains of the night.

     There, in rising day,
     On the grass they play;
     Parents were afar,
     Strangers came not near,
     And the maiden soon forgot her fear.

     Tired with kisses sweet,
     They agree to meet
     When the silent sleep
     Waves o'er heaven's deep,
     And the weary tired wanderers weep.

     To her father white
     Came the maiden bright;
     But his loving look,
     Like the holy book,
     All her tender limbs with terror shook.

     `Ona! pale and weak!
     To thy father speak:
     O! the trembling fear.
     O! the dismal care,
     That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!'

     A little black thing among the snow,
     Crying `'weep! 'weep!' in notes of woe!
     `Where are thy father and mother, say?'--
     `They are both gone up to the Church to pray

     `Because I was happy upon the heath,
     And smil'd among the winter's snow,
     They clothèd me in the clothes of death,
     And taught me to sing the notes of woe.

     `And because I am happy and dance and sing,
     They think they have done me no injury,
     And are gone to praise God and His Priest and King,
     Who make up a Heaven of our misery.'

     Pity would be no more
     If we did not make somebody poor;
     And Mercy no more could be
     If all were as happy as we.

     And mutual fear brings peace,
     Till the selfish loves increase;
     Then Cruelty knits a snare,
     And spreads his baits with care.

     He sits down with holy fears,
     And waters the ground with tears;
     Then Humility takes its root
     Underneath his foot.

     Soon spreads the dismal shade
     Of Mystery over his head;
     And the caterpillar and fly
     Feed on the Mystery.

     And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
     Ruddy and sweet to eat;
     And the raven his nest has made
     In its thickest shade.

     The Gods of the earth and sea
     Sought thro' Nature to find this tree;
     But their search was all in vain:
     There grows one in the Human brain.

<poetry>
Day in melting purple dying,
Blossoms all around me sighing,
Fragrance from the lilies straying,
Zephyr with my ringlets playing,
    Ye but waken my distress:
    I am sick of loneliness.

Thou to whom I love to hearken,
Come ere night around me darken:
Though thy softness but deceive me,
Say thou’rt true, and I’ll believe thee.
    Veil, if ill, thy soul’s intent:
    Let me think it innocent!

Save thy toiling, spare thy treasure:
All I ask is friendship’s pleasure:
Let the shining ore lie darkling;
Bring no gem in lustre sparkling;
    Gifts and gold are nought to me:
    I would only look on thee;

Tell to thee the high-wrought feeling,
Ecstasy but in revealing;
Paint to thee the deep sensation,
Rapture in participation,
    Yet but torture, if comprest
    In a lone unfriended breast.

Absent still? Ah, come and bless me!
Let these eyes again caress thee.
Once, in caution, I could fly thee.
Now I nothing could deny thee.
    In a look if death there be,
    Come, and I will gaze on thee!

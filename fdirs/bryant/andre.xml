    <title>A Song of Pitcairn's Island</title>
    <firstline>Come take our boy, and we will go</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Come take our boy, and we will go
  Before our cabin door;
The winds shall bring us, as they blow,
  The murmurs of the shore;
And we will kiss his young blue eyes,
And I will sing him, as he lies,
  Songs that were made of yore:
I'll sing, in his delighted ear,
The island lays thou lov'st to hear.

And thou, while stammering I repeat,
  Thy country's tongue shalt teach;
'Tis not so soft, but far more sweet
  Than my own native speech:
For thou no other tongue didst know,
When, scarcely twenty moons ago,
  Upon Tahete's beach,
Thou cam'st to woo me to be thine,
With many a speaking look and sign.

I knew thy meaning--thou didst praise
  My eyes, my locks of jet;
Ah! well for me they won thy gaze,--
  But thine were fairer yet!
I'm glad to see my infant wear
Thy soft blue eyes and sunny hair,
  And when my sight is met
By his white brow and blooming cheek,
I feel a joy I cannot speak.

Come talk of Europe's maids with me,
  Whose necks and cheeks, they tell,
Outshine the beauty of the sea,
  White foam and crimson shell.
I'll shape like theirs my simple dress,
And bind like them each jetty tress,
  A sight to please thee well:
And for my dusky brow will braid
A bonnet like an English maid.

Come, for the low sunlight calls,
  We lose the pleasant hours;
'Tis lovelier than these cottage walls,--
  That seat among the flowers.
And I will learn of thee a prayer,
To Him who gave a home so fair,
  A lot so blest as ours--
The God who made, for thee and me,
This sweet lone isle amid the sea.

    <title>Innocent child and snow-white flower</title>
    <firstline>Innocent child and snow-white flower</firstline>

<body>
Innocent child and snow-white flower!
Well are ye paired in your opening hour.
Thus should the pure and the lovely meet,
Stainless with stainless, and sweet with sweet.

White as those leaves, just blown apart,
Are the folds of thy own young heart;
Guilty passion and cankering care
Never have left their traces there.

Artless one! though thou gazest now
O'er the white blossom with earnest brow,
Soon will it tire thy childish eye;
Fair as it is, thou wilt throw it by.

Throw it aside in thy weary hour,
Throw to the ground the fair white flower;
Yet, as thy tender years depart,
Keep that white and innocent heart.

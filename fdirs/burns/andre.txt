T:A Red, Red Rose
F:O my Luve 's like a red, red rose

O my Luve 's like a red, red rose
That 's newly sprung in June:
O my Luve 's like the melodie
That's sweetly play'd in tune!

As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
So deep in luve am I:
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry:

Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall run.

And fare thee weel, my only Luve,
And fare thee weel a while!
And I will come again, my Luve,
Tho' it were ten thousand mile.

T:To Mary in Heaven
F:Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray

Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray, 
       That lov'st to greet the early morn, 
Again thou usherast in the day 
       My Mary from my soul was torn. 
O Mary, dear departed shade 
       Where is thy place of blissful rest? 
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? 
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

That sacred hour can I forget? 
       Can I forget the hallow'd grove 
Where, by the winding Ayr, we met, 
       To live one day of parting love? 
Eternity cannot efface 
       Those records dear of transports past, 
Thy image at our last embrace--- 
       Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore, 
       O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green; 
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar, 
       Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene; 
The flowers sprang wanton to be prest 
       The birds sang love on every spray 
Till too, too soon, the glowing west, 
       Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.

Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes, 
       And fondly broods with miser-care; 
Time but th' impression stronger makes, 
       As streams their channels deeper wear. 
O Mary! dear departed shade! 
       Where is thy place of blissful rest? 
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? 
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

T:Sweet Tibbie Dunbar
F:O wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar?

O wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar?
O wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar?
Wilt thou ride on a horse, or be drawn in a car,
Or walk by my side, O sweet Tibbie Dunbar?

I care na thy daddie, his lands and his money,
I care na thy kin, sae high and sae lordly;
But sae that thou'lt hae me for better for waur,
And come in thy coatie, sweet Tibbie Dunbar.

T:My Eppie Macnab
F:O saw ye my dearie, my Eppie Macnab?

O saw ye my dearie, my Eppie Macnab?
O saw ye my dearie, my Eppie Macnab?
She's down in the yard, she's kissin the laird,
She winna come hame to her ain Jock Rab.

O come thy ways to me, my Eppie Macnab;
O come thy ways to me, my Eppie Macnab;
Whate'er thou hast dune, be it late, be it sune,
Thou's welcome again to thy ain Jock Rab.

What says she, my dearie, my Eppie Macnab?
What says she, my dearie, my Eppie Macnab?
She let's thee to wit that she has thee forgot,
And for ever disowns thee, her ain Jock Rab.

O had I ne'er seen thee, my Eppie Macnab!
O had I ne'er seen thee, my Eppie Macnab!
As light as the air, and as fause as thou's fair,
Thou's broken the heart o' thy ain Jock Rab.

"Indeed will I," quo' Findlay.

F:Duncan Gray cam' here to woo

Duncan Gray cam' here to woo,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't,
On blythe Yule-night when we were fou,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't,
Maggie coost her head fu' heigh,
Look'd asklent and unco skeigh,
Gart poor Duncan stand abeigh;
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Duncan fleech'd and Duncan pray'd;
Ha, ha, the wooing o't,
Meg was deaf as Ailsa Craig,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't:
Duncan sigh'd baith out and in,
Grat his e'en baith blear't an' blin',
Spak o' lowpin o'er a linn;
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Time and Chance are but a tide,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't,
Slighted love is sair to bide,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't:
Shall I like a fool, quoth he,
For a haughty hizzie die?
She may gae to-France for me!
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

How it comes let doctors tell,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
Meg grew sick, as he grew hale,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Something in her bosom wrings,
For relief a sigh she brings:
And oh! her een they spak sic things!
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Duncan was a lad o' grace,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't:
Maggie's was a piteous case,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't:
Duncan could na be her death,
Swelling Pity smoor'd his wrath;
Now they're crouse and canty baith,
Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

T:My Spouse Nancy
U:tune-"My Jo Janet."
N:Gendigtet af Jeppe Aakjær: <A D=aakjaer20000924b31>»Nancy«</A>.
F:Husband, husband, cease your strife

"Husband, husband, cease your strife,
Nor longer idly rave, Sir;
Tho' I am your wedded wife
Yet I am not your slave, Sir."
"One of two must still obey,
Nancy, Nancy;
Is it Man or Woman, say,
My spouse Nancy?'

"If 'tis still the lordly word,
Service and obedience;
I'll desert my sov'reign lord,
And so, good bye, allegiance!"
"Sad shall I be, so bereft,
Nancy, Nancy;
Yet I'll try to make a shift,
My spouse Nancy."

"My poor heart, then break it must,
My last hour I am near it:
When you lay me in the dust,
Think how you will bear it."
"I will hope and trust in Heaven,
Nancy, Nancy;
Strength to bear it will be given,
My spouse Nancy."

"Well, Sir, from the silent dead,
Still I'll try to daunt you;
Ever round your midnight bed
Horrid sprites shall haunt you!"
"I'll wed another like my dear
Nancy, Nancy;
Then all hell will fly for fear,
My spouse Nancy."

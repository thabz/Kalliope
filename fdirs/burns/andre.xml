<poetry>
O lassie, art thou sleeping yet,
Or are you waking, I wou'd wit?
For love has bound me hand and foot,
And I wou'd fain be in, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

The morn it is the term-day,
I maun away, I canna stay:
O pity me, before I gay,
And rise and let me in, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

The night it is baith cauld and weet,
The morn it will be snaw and sleet,
My shoen are frozen to my feet
Wi' standing on the plain, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

I am the laird of windy-was,
I come na here without a cause,
And I hae gotten mony fa's
Upon a naked wame o!

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

My father's wa'king on the street,
My mither the chamber-keys does keep,
My chamber-door does chirp and cheep,
And I dare nae let you in, jo!

O gae your way this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night
O gae your way this ae night, for I dare nae let you in, jo!

But I'll come stealing saftly in
And cannily make little dinn,
And then the gate to you I'll find,
If you'l but direct me in, jo!

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

Cast aff the shoen frae aff your feet,
Cast back the door up to the weet,
Syne into my bed you may creep
And do the thing you ken, jo.

O well's on me this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O well's on me this ae night, that ere I let you in, jo!

She let him in sae cannily,
She let him in sae privily,
She let him in sae cannily,
To do the thing ye ken, jo.

O well's on me this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O well's on me this ae night, that ere I let you in, jo!

But ere a' was done and a' was said,
Out fell the bottom of the bed,
The lassie lost her maidenhead,
And her mither heard the din, jo.

O the devil take this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O the devil take this ae night, that ere I let ye in, jo!

What can a young lassie, what shall a young lassie,
What can a young lassie do wi' an auld man?
Bad luck on the pennie, that tempted my Minnie
To sell her poor Jenny for siller and lan'!

He's always compleenin frae morning to e'enin,
He hosts and he hirpls the weary day lang:
He's doyl't and he's dozin, his blude it is frozen.
O, dreary's the night wi' a crazy auld man!

He hums and he hankers, he frets and he cankers,
I never can please him do a' that I can;
He's peevish, and jealous of a' the young fellows,
O, dool on the day I met wi' an auld man!

My auld auntie Katie upon me taks pity,
I'll do my endeavour to follow her plan;
I'll cross him, and wrack him until I heartbreak him,
And then his auld brass will buy me a new pan.

<poetry>
There lived a carl in Kellyburn Braes,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
And he had a wife was the plague o' his days,
And the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime;
[And he had a wife was the plague o' his days,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.]

Ae day as the carl gaed up the lang-glen,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
He met with the devil, says, how do you fen?
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

I've got a bad wife, Sir, that's a' my complaint,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
For, savin your presence, to her ye're a saint,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

It's neither your stot nor your staig I shall crave,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
But gie me your wife, man, for her I must have,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

O, welcome most kindly! the blythe carl said;
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
But if ye can match her - ye're waur than ye're ca'd,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil has got the auld wife on his back,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
And like a poor pedlar he's carried his pack,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

He's carried her hame to his ain hallan-door,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
Syne bade her gae in, for a bitch, and a whore,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

Then straight he makes fifty, the pick o' his band,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
Turn out on her guard in the clap of a hand,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The carlin gaed thro' them like ony wud bear,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
Whae'er she gat hands on, cam near her nae mair,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

A reekit wee devil looks over the wa',
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
O help, Master, help! or she'll ruin us a',
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil he swore by the edge o' his knife,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
He pitied the man that was ty'd to a wife,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil he swore by the kirk and the bell,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
He was not in wedlock, thank Heav'n, but in hell,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

Then Satan has travell'd again wi' his pack,
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
And to her auld husband he's carried her back,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life,
Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.
[But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.]

   <title>Holy Willie's Prayer</title>
   <firstline>O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell,
Who, as it pleases best Thysel',
Sends ane to heaven an' ten to hell,
A' for Thy glory,
And no for ony gude or ill
They've done afore Thee!

I bless and praise Thy matchless might,
When thousands Thou hast left in night,
That I am here afore Thy sight,
For gifts an' grace
A burning and a shining light
To a' this place.

What was I, or my generation,
That I should get sic exaltation,
I wha deserve most just damnation
For broken laws,
Five thousand years ere my creation,
Thro' Adam's cause?

When frae my mither's womb I fell,
Thou might hae plunged me in hell,
To gnash my gums, to weep and wail,
In burnin lakes,
Where damned devils roar and yell,
Chain'd to their stakes.

Yet I am here a chosen sample,
To show thy grace is great and ample;
I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple,
Strong as a rock,
A guide, a buckler, and example,
To a' Thy flock.

O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear,
When drinkers drink, an' swearers swear,
An' singin there, an' dancin here,
Wi' great and sma';
For I am keepit by Thy fear
Free frae them a'.

But yet, O Lord! confess I must,
At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust:
An' sometimes, too, in wardly trust,
Vile self gets in:
But Thou remembers we are dust,
Defil'd wi' sin.

O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg -
Thy pardon I sincerely beg,
O! may't ne'er be a livin plague
To my dishonour,
An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg
Again upon her.

Besides, I farther maun avow,
Wi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow -
But Lord, that Friday I was fou,
When I cam near her;
Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true
Wad never steer her.

Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn
Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn,
Lest he owre proud and high shou'd turn,
That he's sae gifted:
If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne,
Until Thou lift it.

Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place,
For here Thou hast a chosen race:
But God confound their stubborn face,
An' blast their name,
Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace
An' public shame.

Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts;
He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes,
Yet has sae mony takin arts,
Wi' great and sma',
Frae God's ain priest the people's hearts
He steals awa.

An' when we chasten'd him therefor,
Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,
An' set the warld in a roar
O' laughing at us; -
Curse Thou his basket and his store,
Kail an' potatoes.

Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r,
Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr;
Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare
Upo' their heads;
Lord visit them, an' dinna spare,
For their misdeeds.

O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken,
My vera heart and flesh are quakin,
To think how we stood sweatin', shakin,
An' piss'd wi' dread,
While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin,
Held up his head.

Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him,
Lord, visit them wha did employ him,
And pass not in Thy mercy by 'em,
Nor hear their pray'r,
But for Thy people's sake, destroy 'em,
An' dinna spare.

But, Lord, remember me an' mine
Wi' mercies temp'ral an' divine,
That I for grace an' gear may shine,
Excell'd by nane,
And a' the glory shall be thine,
Amen, Amen!

   <title>Man Was Made To Mourn</title>
   <firstline>When chill November's surly blast</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
When chill November's surly blast
Made fields and forests bare,
One ev'ning, as I wander'd forth
Along the banks of Ayr,
I spied a man, whose aged step
Seem'd weary, worn with care;
His face was furrow'd o'er with years,
And hoary was his hair.

"Young stranger, whither wand'rest thou?"
Began the rev'rend sage;
"Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain,
Or youthful pleasure's rage?
Or haply, prest with cares and woes,
Too soon thou hast began
To wander forth, with me to mourn
The miseries of man.

"The sun that overhangs yon moors,
Out-spreading far and wide,
Where hundreds labour to support
A haughty lordling's pride; -
I've seen yon weary winter-sun
Twice forty times return;
And ev'ry time has added proofs,
That man was made to mourn.

"O man! while in thy early years,
How prodigal of time!
Mis-spending all thy precious hours-
Thy glorious, youthful prime!
Alternate follies take the sway;
Licentious passions burn;
Which tenfold force gives Nature's law.
That man was made to mourn.

"Look not alone on youthful prime,
Or manhood's active might;
Man then is useful to his kind,
Supported in his right:
But see him on the edge of life,
With cares and sorrows worn;
Then Age and Want - oh! ill-match'd pair -
Shew man was made to mourn.

"A few seem favourites of fate,
In pleasure's lap carest;
Yet, think not all the rich and great
Are likewise truly blest:
But oh! what crowds in ev'ry land,
All wretched and forlorn,
Thro' weary life this lesson learn,
That man was made to mourn.

"Many and sharp the num'rous ills
Inwoven with our frame!
More pointed still we make ourselves,
Regret, remorse, and shame!
And man, whose heav'n-erected face
The smiles of love adorn, -
Man's inhumanity to man
Makes countless thousands mourn!

"See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight,
So abject, mean, and vile,
Who begs a brother of the earth
To give him leave to toil;
And see his lordly fellow-worm
The poor petition spurn,
Unmindful, tho' a weeping wife
And helpless offspring mourn.

"If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave,
By Nature's law design'd,
Why was an independent wish
E'er planted in my mind?
If not, why am I subject to
His cruelty, or scorn?
Or why has man the will and pow'r
To make his fellow mourn?

"Yet, let not this too much, my son,
Disturb thy youthful breast:
This partial view of human-kind
Is surely not the last!
The poor, oppressed, honest man
Had never, sure, been born,
Had there not been some recompense
To comfort those that mourn!

"O Death! the poor man's dearest friend,
The kindest and the best!
Welcome the hour my aged limbs
Are laid with thee at rest!
The great, the wealthy fear thy blow
From pomp and pleasure torn;
But, oh! a blest relief for those
That weary-laden mourn!"

And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall run.

And fare thee weel, my only Luve,
And fare thee weel a while!
And I will come again, my Luve,

<poetry>
Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray,
       That lov'st to greet the early morn,
Again thou usherast in the day
       My Mary from my soul was torn.
O Mary, dear departed shade
       Where is thy place of blissful rest?
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

That sacred hour can I forget?
       Can I forget the hallow'd grove
Where, by the winding Ayr, we met,
       To live one day of parting love?
Eternity cannot efface
       Those records dear of transports past,
Thy image at our last embrace—-
       Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore,
       O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green;
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar,
       Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene;
The flowers sprang wanton to be prest
       The birds sang love on every spray
Till too, too soon, the glowing west,
       Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.

Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes,
       And fondly broods with miser-care;
Time but th' impression stronger makes,
       As streams their channels deeper wear.
O Mary! dear departed shade!
       Where is thy place of blissful rest?
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

Duncan Gray cam here to woo,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
On blythe yule night when we were fou,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.
Maggie coost her head fu' high,
Look'd asklent and unco skeigh,
Gart poor Duncan stand abeigh;
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Duncan fleech'd, and Duncan pray'd,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
Meg was deaf as Ailsa Craig,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.
Duncan sigh'd baith out and in,
Grat his een baith bleer't and blin',
Spak o' lowpin o'er a linn;
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Time and chance are but a tide,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
Slighted love is sair to bide,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.
Shall I, like a fool, quoth he,
For a haughty hizzie die?
She may gae to—France for me!
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

How it comes let doctors tell,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
Meg grew sick—as he grew heal,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.
Something in her bosom wrings,
For relief a sigh she brings:
And O, her een, they spak sic things!
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Duncan was a lad o' grace.
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't;
Maggie's was a piteous case,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.
Duncan could na be her death,
Swelling pity smoor'd his wrath;
Now they're crouse and canty baith,
  Ha, ha, the wooing o't.

Is it man or woman, say,

If 'tis still the lordly word,

  And so, good bye, allegiance!
"Sad will I be, so bereft,

Yet I'll try to make a shift,

My poor heart then break it must,

When you lay me in the dust,
  Think, think, how you will bear it.
"I will hope and trust in heaven,

Strength to bear it will be given,

Well, sir, from the silent dead,
  Still I'll try to daunt you;
Ever round your midnight bed
  Horrid sprites shall haunt you.
"I'll wed another, like my dear

Then all hell will fly for fear,

   <title>A Prayer, Under the Pressure of violent Anguish</title>

<poetry>
O Thou Great Being! what Thou art,
Surpasses me to know:
Yet sure I am, that known to Thee
Are all Thy works below.

Thy creature here before Thee stands,
All wretched and distrest;
Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
Obey Thy high behest.

Sure Thou, Almighty, canst not act
From cruelty or wrath!
O, free my weary eyes from tears,
Or close them fast in death!

But if I must afflicted be,
To suit some wise design;
Then man my soul with firm resolves
To bear and not repine!

O Thou unknown, Almighty Cause
Of all my hope and fear!
In whose dread presence, ere an hour,
Perhaps I must appear!

If I have wander'd in those paths
Of life I ought to shun,
As something, loudly, in my breast,
Remonstrates I have done;

Thou know'st that Thou hast formed me
With passions wild and strong;
And list'ning to their witching voice
Has often led me wrong.

Where human weakness has come short,
Or frailty stept aside,
Do Thou, All-Good -for such Thou art-
In shades of darkness hide.

Where with intention I have err'd,
No other plea I have,
But, Thou art good; and Goodness still
Delighteth to forgive.

Is there for honest Poverty
  That hings his head, an’ a’ that;
The coward slave-we pass him by,
  We dare be poor for a’ that!
For a’ that, an’ a’ that.
  Our toils obscure an’ a’ that,
The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,
  The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.

What though on hamely fare we dine,
  Wear hoddin grey, an’ a that;
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;
  A Man’s a Man for a’ that:
For a’ that, and a’ that,
  Their tinsel show, an’ a’ that;
The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor,
  Is king o’ men for a’ that.

Ye see yon birkie, ca’d a lord,
  Wha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that;
Tho’ hundreds worship at his word,
  He’s but a coof for a’ that:
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
  His ribband, star, an’ a’ that:
The man o’ independent mind
  He looks an’ laughs at a’ that.

A prince can mak a belted knight,
  A marquis, duke, an’ a’ that;
But an honest man’s abon his might,
  Gude faith, he maunna fa’ that!
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
  Their dignities an’ a’ that;
The pith o’ sense, an’ pride o’ worth,
  Are higher rank than a’ that.

Then let us pray that come it may,
  (As come it will for a’ that,)
That Sense and Worth, o’er a’ the earth,
  Shall bear the gree, an’ a’ that.
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
  It’s coming yet for a’ that,
That Man to Man, the world o’er,
  Shall brothers be for a’ that.

On a bank of flowers, in a summer day,
  For summer lightly drest,
The youthful, blooming Nelly lay,
  With love and sleep opprest;
When Willie, wand’ring thro’ the wood,
Who for her favour oft had sued;
    He gaz’d, he wish’d
    He fear’d, he blush’d,
And trembled where he stood.

Her closèd eyes, like weapons sheath’d,
  Were seal’d in soft repose;
Her lip, still as she fragrant breath’d,
  It richer dyed the rose;
The springing lilies, sweetly prest,
Wild-wanton kissed her rival breast;
    He gaz’d, he wish’d,
    He mear’d, he blush’d,
His bosom ill at rest.

Her robes, light-waving in the breeze,
  Her tender limbs embrace;
Her lovely form, her native ease,
  All harmony and grace;
Tumultuous tides his pulses roll,
A faltering, ardent kiss he stole;
    He gaz’d, he wish’d,
    He fear’d, he blush’d,
And sigh’d his very soul.

As flies the partridge from the brake,
  On fear-inspired wings,
So Nelly, starting, half-awake,
  Away affrighted springs;
But Willie follow’d-as he should,
He overtook her in the wood;
    He vow’d, he pray’d,
    He found the maid
Forgiving all, and good.

When lyart leaves bestrow the yird,
Or wavering like the bauckie-bird,
  Bedim cauld Boreas’ blast;
When hailstanes drive wi’ bitter skyte,
And infant frosts begin to bite,
  In hoary cranreuch drest;
Ae night at e’en a merry core
  O’ randie, gangrel bodies,
In Poosie-Nansie’s held the splore,
  To drink their orra duddies;
    Wi’ quaffing an’ laughing,
      They ranted an’ they sang,
    Wi’ jumping an’ thumping,
      The vera girdle rang,

First, neist the fire, in auld red rags,
Ane sat, weel brac’d wi’ mealy bags,
  And knapsack a’ in order;
His doxy lay within his arm;
Wi’ usquebae an’ blankets warm
  She blinkit on her sodger;
An’ aye he gies the tozie drab
  The tither skelpin’ kiss,
While she held up her greedy gab,
  Just like an aumous dish;
    Ilk smack still, did crack still,
      Just like a cadger’s whip;
    Then staggering an’ swaggering
      He roar’d this ditty up—


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“Soldier’s Joy.”</center></nonum>

I am a son of Mars who have been in many wars,
  And show my cuts and scars wherever I come;
This here was for a wench, and that other in a trench,
  When welcoming the French at the sound of the drum.
                  Lal de daudle, &amp;c.

My ’prenticeship I past where my leader breath’d his last,
  When the bloody die was cast on the heights of Abram:
And I served out my trade when the gallant game was play’d,
  And the Morro low was laid at the sound of the drum.

I lastly was with Curtis among the floating batt’ries,
  And there I left for witness an arm and a limb;
Yet let my country need me, with Elliot to head me,
  I’d clatter on my stumps at the sound of a drum.

And now tho’ I must beg, with a wooden arm and leg,
  And many a tatter’d rag hanging over my bum,
I’m as happy with my wallet, my bottle, and my callet,
  As when I used in scarlet to follow a drum.

What tho’ with hoary locks, I must stand the winter shocks,
  Beneath the woods and rocks oftentimes for a home,
When the t’other bag I sell, and the t’other bottle tell,
  I could meet a troop of hell, at the sound of a drum.


<nonum><center><i>Recitativo</i></center></nonum>

He ended; and the kebars sheuk,
  Aboon the chorus roar;
While frighted rattons backward leuk,
  An’ seek the benmost bore:
A fairy fiddler frae the neuk,
  He skirl’d out, encore!
But up arose the martial chuck,
  An’ laid the loud uproar.


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“Sodger Laddie.”</center></nonum>

I once was a maid, tho’ I cannot tell when,
And still my delight is in proper young men;
Some one of a troop of dragoons was my daddie,
No wonder I’m fond of a sodger laddie,
                        Sing, lal de lal, &amp;c.

The first of my loves was a swaggering blade,
To rattle the thundering drum was his trade;
His leg was so tight, and his cheek was so ruddy,
Transported I was with my sodger laddie.

But the godly old chaplain left him in the lurch;
The sword I forsook for the sake of the church:
He ventur’d the soul, and I risked the body,
’Twas then I proved false to my sodger laddie.

Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified sot,
The regiment at large for a husband I got;
From the gilded spontoon to the fife I was ready,
I askèd no more but a sodger laddie.

But the peace it reduc’d me to beg in despair,
Till I met old boy in a Cunningham fair,
His rags regimental, they flutter’d so gaudy,
My heart it rejoic’d at a sodger laddie.

And now I have liv’d—I know not how long,
And still I can join in a cup and a song;
But whilst with both hands I can hold the glass steady,
Here’s to thee, my hero, my sodger laddie.


<nonum><center><i>Recitativo</i></center></nonum>

Poor Merry-Andrew, in the neuk,
  Sat guzzling wi’ a tinkler-hizzie;
They mind’t na wha the chorus teuk,
  Between themselves they were sae busy:
  At length, wi’ drink an’ courting dizzy,
He stoiter’d up an’ made a face;
  Then turn’d an’ laid a smack on Grizzie,
Syne tun’d his pipes wi’ grave grimace.


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“Auld Sir Symon.”</center></nonum>

Sir Wisdom’s a fool when he’s fou;
  Sir Knave is a fool in a session;
He’s there but a ’prentice I trow,
  But I am a fool by profession.

My grannie she bought me a beuk,
  An’ I held awa to the school;
I fear I my talent misteuk,
  But what will ye hae of a fool?

For drink I would venture my neck;
  A hizzie’s the half of my craft;
But what could ye other expect
  Of ane that’s avowedly daft?

I ance was tied up like a stirk,
  For civilly swearing and quaffin;
I ance was abus’d i’ the kirk,
  For towsing a lass i’ my daffin.

Poor Andrew that tumbles for sport,
  Let naebody name wi’ a jeer;
There’s even, I’m tauld, i’ the Court
  A tumbler ca’d the Premier.

Observ’d ye yon reverend lad
  Mak faces to tickle the mob;
He rails at our mountebank squad,—
  It’s rivalship just i’ the job.

And now my conclusion I’ll tell,
  For faith I’m confoundedly dry;
The chiel that’s a fool for himsel’,
  Guid L—d! he’s far dafter than I.

Then niest outspak a raucle carlin,
Wha kent fu’ weel to cleek the sterlin;
For mony a pursie she had hooked,
An’ had in mony a well been douked;
Her love had been a Highland laddie,
But weary fa’ the waefu’ woodie!
Wi’ sighs an’ sobs she thus began
To wail her braw John Highlandman.


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“O, an ye were dead, Guidman.”</center></nonum>

A Highland lad my love was born,
The Lalland laws he held in scorn;
But he still was faithfu’ to his clan,
My gallant, braw John Highlandman.


<nonum><center><i>Chorus</i></center></nonum>

  Sing hey my braw John Highlandman!
  Sing ho my braw John Highlandman!
  There’s not a lad in a’ the lan’
  Was match for my John Highlandman.

With his philibeg an’ tartan plaid,
An’ guid claymore down by his side,
The ladies’ hearts he did trepan,
My gallant, braw John Highlandman.
                    Sing hey, &amp;c.

We rangèd a’ from Tweed to Spey,
An’ liv’d like lords an’ ladies gay;
For a Lalland face he fearèd none,—
My gallant, braw John Highlandman.
                    Sing hey, &amp;c.

They banish’d him beyond the sea.
But ere the bud was on the tree,
Adown my cheeks the pearls ran,
Embracing my John Highlandman.
                    Sing hey, &amp;c.

But, och! they catch’d him at the last,
And bound him in a dungeon fast:
My curse upon them every one,
They’ve hang’d my braw John Highlandman!
                    Sing hey, &amp;c.

And now a widow, I must mourn
The pleasures that will ne’er return:
The comfort but a hearty can,
When I think on John Highlandman.
                    Sing hey, &amp;c.

A pigmy scraper wi’ his fiddle,
Wha us’d at trystes an’ fairs to driddle.
Her strappin limb and gausy middle
                    (He reach’d nae higher)
Had hol’d his heartie like a riddle,
                    An’ blawn’t on fire.

Wi’ hand on hainch, and upward e’e,
He croon’d his gamut, one, two, three,
Then in an arioso key,
                    The wee Apoll
Set off wi’ allegretto glee

An’ then your every care an’ fear

<nonum><center><i>Chorus</i></center></nonum>

  I am a fiddler to my trade,
  An’ a’ the tunes that e’er I played,
  The sweetest still to wife or maid,
    Was whistle owre the lave o’t.

At kirns an’ weddins we’se be there,
An’ O sae nicely’s we will fare!
We’ll bowse about till Daddie Care
  Sing whistle owre the lave o’t.
                    I am, &amp;c.

Sae merrily’s the banes we’ll pyke,
An’ sun oursel’s about the dyke;
An’ at our leisure, when ye like,
  We’ll whistle owre the lave o’t.
                    I am, &amp;c.

But bless me wi’ your heav’n o’ charms,
An’ while I kittle hair on thairms,
Hunger, cauld, an’ a’ sic harms,
  May whistle owre the lave o’t.
                    I am, &amp;c.

Her charms had struck a sturdy caird,
  As weel as poor gut-scraper;
He taks the fiddler by the beard,
  An’ draws a roosty rapier—
He swoor, by a’ was swearing worth,
  To speet him like a pliver,
Unless he would from that time forth
  Relinquish her for ever.

Wi’ ghastly e’e poor tweedle-dee
  Upon his hunkers bended,
An’ pray’d for grace wi’ ruefu’ face,
  An’ so the quarrel ended.
But tho’ his little heart did grieve
  When round the tinkler prest her,
He feign’d to snirtle in his sleeve,
  When thus the caird address’d her:


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“Clout the Cauldron.”</center></nonum>


My bonie lass, I work in brass,
  A tinkler is my station:
I’ve travell’d round all Christian ground
  In this my occupation;
I’ve taen the gold, an’ been enrolled
  In many a noble squadron;
But vain they search’d when off I march’d
  To go an’ clout the cauldron.
                  I’ve taen the gold, &amp;c.

Despise that shrimp, that wither’d imp,
  With a’ his noise an’ cap’rin;
An’ take a share with those that bear
  The budget and the apron!
And by that stowp! my faith an’ houp,
And by that dear Kilbaigie,<note>* A peculiar sort of whisky so called, a great favorite with Poosie Nansie’s clubs.</note>
If e’er ye want, or meet wi’ scant,
  May I ne’er weet my craigie.
                  And by that stowp, &amp;c.


<nonum><center><i>Recitativo</i></center></nonum>

The caird prevail’d—th’ unblushing fair
  In his embraces sunk;
Partly wi’ love o’ercome sae sair,
  An’ partly she was drunk:
Sir Violino, with an air
  That show’d a man o’ spunk,
Wish’d unison between the pair,
  An’ made the bottle clunk
                To their health that night.

But hurchin Cupid shot a shaft,
  That play’d a dame a shavie—
The fiddler rak’d her, fore and aft,
  Behint the chicken cavie.
Her lord, a wight of Homer’s craft,<note>* Homer is allowed to be the oldest ballad-singer on record.</note>
  Tho’ limpin wi’ the spavie,
He hirpl’d up, an’ lap like daft,
  An’ shor’d them Dainty Davie
                O’ boot that night.

He was a care-defying blade
  As ever Bacchus listed!
Tho’ Fortune sair upon him laid,
  His heart, she ever miss’d it.
He had no wish but—to be glad,
  Nor want but—when he thirsted;
He hated nought but—to be sad,
  An’ thus the muse suggested
                His sang that night.


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“For a’ that, an’ a’ that.”</center></nonum>

I am a Bard of no regard,
  Wi’ gentle folks an’ a’ that;
But Homer-like, the glowrin byke,
  Frae town to town I draw that.


<nonum><center><i>Chorus</i></center></nonum>

  For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
    An’ twice as muckle’s a’ that;
  I’ve lost but ane, I’ve twa behin’,
    I’ve wife eneugh for a’ that.

I never drank the Muses’ stank,
  Castalia’s burn, an’ a’ that;
But there it streams an’ richly reams,
  My Helicon I ca’ that.
              For a’ that, &amp;c.

Great love Idbear to a’ the fair,
  Their humble slave an’ a’ that;
But lordly will, I hold it still
  A mortal sin to thraw that.
              For a’ that, &amp;c.

In raptures sweet, this hour we meet,
  Wi’ mutual love an’ a’ that;
But for how lang the flie may stang,
  Let inclination law that.
              For a’ that, &amp;c.

Their tricks an’ craft hae put me daft,
  They’ve taen me in, an’ a’ that;
But clear your decks, and here’s—“The Sex!”
  I like the jads for a’ that.


<nonum><center><i>Chorus</i></center></nonum>

  For a’ that, an’ a’ that,

So sang the bard—and Nansie’s wa’s
Shook with a thunder of applause,
    Re-echo’d from each mouth!
They toom’d their pocks, they pawn’d their duds,
They scarcely left to co’er their fuds,
    To quench their lowin drouth:
Then owre again, the jovial thrang
    The poet did request
To lowse his pack an’ wale a sang,
    A ballad o’ the best;
      He rising, rejoicing,
        Between his twa Deborahs,
      Looks round him, an’ found them
        Impatient for the chorus.


<nonum><center><i>Air</i></center></nonum>
<nonum><center><i>Tune—</i>“Jolly Mortals, fill your Glasses.”</center></nonum>

See the smoking bowl before us,
  Mark our jovial ragged ring!
Round and round take up the chorus,
  And in raptures let us sing—


<nonum><center><i>Chorus</i></center></nonum>

  A fig for those by law protected!
    Liberty’s a glorious feast!
  Courts for cowards were erected,
    Churches built to please the priest.

What is title, what is treasure,
  What is reputation’s care?
If we lead a life of pleasure,
  ’Tis no matter how or where!
                A fig for, &amp;c.

With the ready trick and fable,
  Round we wander all the day;
And at night in barn or stable,
  Hug our doxies on the hay.
                A fig for, &amp;c.

Does the train-attended carriage
  Thro’ the country lighter rove?
Does the sober bed of marriage
  Witness brighter scenes of love?
                A fig for, &amp;c.

Life is al a variorum,
  We regard not how it goes;
Let them cant about decorum,
  Who have character to lose.
                A fig for, &amp;c.

Here’s to budgets, bags and wallets!
  Here’s to all the wandering train.
Here’s our ragged brats and callets,
  One and all cry out, Amen!

    <title>Lament of Mary, Queen of Scots, on the Approach of Spring</title>
    <firstline>Now Nature hangs her mantle green</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
Now Nature hangs her mantle green
  On every blooming tree,
And spreads her sheets o' daisies white
  Out o'er the grassy lea:
Now Phoebus cheers the crystal streams,
  And glads the azure skies;
But nought can glad the weary wight
  That fast in durance lies.

Now lav'rocks wake the merry morn,
  Aloft on dewy wing;
The merle, in his noontide bow'r,
  Makes woodland echoes ring;
The mavis wild wi' mony a note,
  Sings drowsy day to rest:
In love and freedom they rejoice,
  Wi' care nor thrall opprest.

Now blooms the lily by the bank,
  The primrose down the brae;
The hawthorn's budding in the glen,
  And milk-white is the slae;
The meanest hind in fair Scotland
  May rove their sweets amang;
But I, the Queen of a' Scotland,
  Maun lie in prison strang!

I was the Queen o' bonnie France,
  Where happy I hae been;
Fu' lightly rase I in the morn,
  As blythe lay down at e'en:
And I'm the sov'reign o' Scotland,
  And mony a traitor there;
Yet here I lie in foreign bands
  And never-ending care.

But as for thee, thou false woman!
  My sister and my fae,
Grim vengeance yet shall whet a sword
  That thro' thy soul shall gae!
The weeping blood in woman's breast
  Was never known to thee;
Nor th' balm that draps on wounds of woe
  Frae woman's pitying e'e.

My son! my son! may kinder stars
  Upon thy fortune shine;
And may those pleasures gild thy reign,
  That ne'er wad blink on mine!
God keep thee frae thy mother's faes,
  Or turn their hearts to thee:
And where thou meet'st thy mother's friend
  Remember him for me!

O! soon, to me, may summer suns
  Nae mair light up the morn!
Nae mair, to me, the autumn winds
  Wave o'er the yellow corn!
And in the narrow house o' death
  Let winter round me rave;
And the next flow'rs that deck the spring
  Bloom on my peaceful grave!

  I'll be slave to naebody;
I hae a guid braid sword,

I'll be merry and free,

Naebody cares for me,

For sure 'twere impious to despair,

My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;
A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe—
My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go.
Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,
The birth-place of valour, the country of worth;
Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.

Farewell to the mountains high cover'd with snow;
Farewell to the straths and green valleys below:
Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods;
Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.
My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here,
My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;
Chasing the wild deer, and following the roe—
My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go.

  Lassie wi' the lint-white locks,

Now nature cleeds the flowery lea,
And a' is young and sweet like thee;
O wilt thou share its joy wi' me,
  And say thoul't be my dearie, O?

And when the welcome simmer shower
Has cheer'd ilk drooping little flower,
We'll to the breathing woodbine bower
  At sultry noon, my dearie, O.

When Cynthia lights wi' silver ray,
The weary shearer's hameward way;
Thro' yellow waving fields we'll stray,
  And talk o' love my dearie, O.

And when the howling wintry blast
Disturbs my lassie's midnight rest;
Enclasped to my faithfu' breast,
  I'll comfort thee, my dearie, O.

    Lassie wi' the lint-white locks,
      Bonnie lassie, artless lassie,
    Wilt thou wi' me tent the flocks?

But lately seen in gladsome green,
  The woods rejoiced the day;
Thro' gentle showers and laughing flowers,
  In double pride were gay:
But now our joys are fled
  On winter blasts awa!
Yet maiden May, in rich array,
  Again shall bring them a'.

But my white pow, nae kindly thowe
  Shall melt the snaws of age;
My trunk of eild, but buss or bield,
  Sinks in Time's wintry rage.
Oh! age has weary days,
  And nights o' sleepless pain!
Thou golden time o' youthfu' prime,
  Why comes thou not again?

<poetry>
Of a' the airts the wind can blaw,
  I dearly like the west,
For there the bonnie lassie lives,
  The lassie I lo'e best:
There wild-woods grow, and rivers row,
  And mony a hill between;
But day and night my fancy's flight
  Is ever wi' my Jean.

I see her in the dewy flowers,
  I see her sweet and fair:
I hear her in the tunefu' birds,
  I hear her charm the air:
There's not a bonnie flower that springs
  By fountain, shaw, or green,
There's not a bonnie bird that sings,
  But minds me o' my Jean.

O blaw, ye westlin winds, blaw saft
  Among the leafy trees,
Wi' balmy gale, frae hill and dale
  Bring hame the laden bees;
And bring the lassie back to me
  That's aye sae neat and clean;
Ae smile o' her wad banish care,
  Sae charming is my Jean.

What sighs and vows amang the knowes
  Hae passed atween us twa!
How fond to meet, how wae to part,
  That night she gaed awa!
The powers aboon can only ken,
  To whom the heart is seen,
That nane can be sae dear to me
  As my sweet lovely Jean!

    <title>The Joyful Widower</title>
    <firstline>I married with a scolding wife</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
I married with a scolding wife
  The fourteenth of November;
She made me weary of my life,
  By one unruly member.
Long did I bear the heavy yoke,
  And many griefs attended;
But to my comfort be it spoke,
  Now, now her life is ended.

We liv'd full one-and-twenty years
  A man and wife together;
At length from me her course she steer'd,
  And gone I know not whither:
Would I could guess, I do profess,
  I speak, and do not flatter,
Of all the woman in the world,
  I never could come at her.

Her body is bestowed well,
  A handsome grave does hide her;
But sure her soul is not in hell,
  The deil would ne'er abide her.
I rather think she is aloft,
  And imitating thunder;
For why,—methinks I hear her voice
  Tearing the clouds asunder.

Powers celestial! whose protection
  Ever guards the virtuous fair,
While in distant climes I wander,

Let her form sae fair and faultless,
  Fair and faultless as your own,
Let my Mary's kindred spirit
  Draw your choicest influence down.

Make the gales you waft around her
  Soft and peaceful as her breast;
Breathing in the breeze that fans her,
  Soothe her bosom into rest:
Guardian angels! O protect her,
  When in distant lands I roam;
To realms unknown while fate exiles me,
  Make her bosom still my home.

    <title>The poor and honest Sodger</title>
    <firstline>When wild war's deadly blast was blawn</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
When wild war's deadly blast was blawn
  And gentle peace returning,
Wi' mony a sweet babe fatherless,
  And mony a widow mourning;
I left the lines and tented field,
  Where lang I'd been a lodger,
My humble knapsack a' my wealth,
  A poor and honest sodger.

A leal, light heart was in my breast,
My hand unstain'd wi' plunder;
And for fair Scotia, hame again,
  I cheery on did wander.
I thought upon the banks o' Coil,
  I thought upon my Nancy,
I thought upon the witching smile
  That caught my youthful fancy.

At length I reach'd the bonny glen,
  Where early life I sported;
I pass'd the mill, and trysting thorn,
  Where Nancy aft I courted:
Wha spied I but my ain dear maid,
  Down by her mother's dwelling!
And turn'd me round to hide the flood
  That in my een was swelling.

Wi' alter'd voice, quoth I, sweet lass,
  Sweet as yon hawthorn's blossom,
O! happy, happy, may he be
  That's dearest to thy bosom!
My purse is light, I've far to gang,
  And fain wud be thy lodger;
I've serv'd my king and country lang—
  Take pity on a sodger.

Sae wistfully she gaz'd on me,
  And lovelier was then ever;
Quo' she, a sodger ance I lo'd,
  Forget him shall I never:
Our humble cot, and hamely fare,
  Ye freely shall partake it,
That gallant badge—the dear cockade—
  Ye're welcome for the sake o't.

She gaz'd—she redden'd like a rose—
  Syne pale like onie lily;
She sank within my arms, and cried,
  Art thou my ain dear Willie?
By him who made yon sun and sky—
  By whom true love's regarded,
I am the man: and thus may still
  True lovers be rewarded!

The wars are o'er, and I'm come hame,
  And find thee still true-hearted;
Tho' poor in gear, we're rich in love,
  And mair we'se ne'er be parted.
Quo' she, my grandsire left me gowd,
  A mailen plenish'd fairly;
And come, my faithful sodger lad,
  Thou'rt welcome to it dearly!

For gold the merchant ploughs the main,
  The farmer ploughs the manor;
But glory is the sodger's prize,
  The sodger's wealth is honour;
The brave poor sodger ne'er despise,
  Nor count him as a stranger;
Remember he's his country's stay,
  In day and hour of danger.

Ye gallants bright, I red ye right,

Her een sae bright, like stars by night,
  Her skin is like the swan;
Sae jimply lac'd her genty waist,
  That sweetly ye might span.

Youth, grace, and love attendant move,
  And pleasure leads the van:
In a' their charms, and conquering arms,
  They wait on bonnie Ann.
The captive bands may chain the hands,
  But love enclaves the man;
Ye Gallants braw, I red you a',
  Beware of bonnie Ann!

Ae fond kiss, and then we sever;
Ae fareweel, and then for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
Who shall say that fortune grieves him
While the star of hope she leaves him?
Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.

I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,
Naething could resist my Nancy;
But to see her, was to love her;
Love but her, and love for ever.--
Had we never lov'd sae kindly,
Had we never lov'd sae blindly,
Never met--or never parted,
We had ne'er been broken hearted.

Fare thee weel, thou first and fairest!
Fare thee weel, thou best and dearest!
Thine be ilka joy and treasure,
Peace, enjoyment, love, and pleasure!
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever;
Ae farewell, alas! for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee!

O luve will venture in
  Where it daurna weel be seen;
O luve will venture in

But I will down yon river rove,
  Among the wood sae green--
And a' to pu' a posie

The primrose I will pu',
  The firstling o' the year,
And I will pu' the pink,
  The emblem o' my dear,
For she's the pink o' womankind,
  And blooms without a peer--
And a' to be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

I'll pu' the budding rose,
  When Phoebus peeps in view,
For it's like a baumy kiss
  O' her sweet bonnie mou';
The hyacinth's for constancy,
  Wi' its unchanging blue--
And a' to be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

The lily it is pure,
  And the lily it is fair,
And in her lovely bosom
  I'll place the lily there;
The daisy's for simplicity,
  And unaffected air--
And a' to be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

The hawthorn I will pu'
  Wi' its locks o' siller gray,
Where, like an aged man,
  It stands at break of day.
But the songster's nest within the bush
  I winna tak away--
And a' to be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

The woodbine I will pu'
  When the e'ening star is near,
And the diamond drops o' dew
  Shall be her e'en sae clear;
The violet's for modesty,
  Which weel she fa's to wear,
And a' to be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

I'll tie the posie round,
  Wi' the silken band o' luve,
And I'll place it in her breast,
  And I'll swear by a' above,
That to my latest draught of life
  The band shall ne'er remove,
And this will be a posie
  To my ain dear May.

Flow gently, sweet Afton! among thy green braes,
Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise;
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream--
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.

Thou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro' the glen;
Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den;
Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear--
I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.

How lofty, sweet Afton! thy neighbouring hills,
Far mark'd with the courses of clear, winding rills;
There daily I wander as noon rises high,
My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye.

How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,
Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow!
There, oft as mild evening weeps over the lea,
The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.

Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,
And winds by the cot where my Mary resides;
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,
As gathering sweet flow'rets she stems thy clear wave.

Flow gently, sweet Afton! among thy green braes,
Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays!
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream--
Flow gently, sweet Afton! disturb not her dream.

    <title>The Twa Herds</title>
    <firstline>O a' ye pious godly flocks</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
O a' ye pious godly flocks,
Weel fed on pastures orthodox,
Wha now will keep you frae the fox,
Or worrying tykes?
Or wha will tent the waifs an' crocks,
About the dykes?

The twa best herds in a' the wast,
The e'er ga'e gospel horn a blast
These five an' twenty simmers past
Oh, dool to tell!
Hae had a bitter black out-cast
Atween themsel'.

O, Moodie, man, an' wordy Russell,
How could you raise so vile a bustle;
Ye'll see how New-Light herds will whistle,
An' think it fine!
The Lord's cause ne'er gat sic a twistle,
Sin' I hae min'.

O, sirs! whae'er wad hae expeckit
Your duty ye wad sae negleckit,
Ye wha were ne'er by lairds respeckit
To wear the plaid;
But by the brutes themselves eleckit,
To be their guide.

What flock wi' Moodie's flock could rank?
Sae hale and hearty every shank!
Nae poison'd soor Arminian stank
He let them taste;
But Calvin's fountainhead they drank -
O, sic a feast!

The thummart, willcat, brock, an' tod,
Weel kend his voice thro' a' the wood,
He smell'd their ilka hole an' road,
Baith out an in;
An' weel he lik'd to shed their bluid,
An' sell their skin.

What herd like Russell tell'd his tale;
His voice was heard thro' muir and dale,
He kenn'd the Lord's sheep, ilka tail,
Owre a' the height;
An' saw gin they were sick or hale,
At the first sight.

He fine a mangy sheep could scrub,
Or nobly fling the gospel club,
And New-Light herds could nicely drub
Or pay their skin;
Could shake them o'er the burning dub,
Or heave them in.

Sic twa - O! do I live to see't?
Sic famous twa should disagree't,
And names, like "villain," "hypocrite,"
Ilk ither gi'en,
While New-Light herds, wi' laughin spite,
Say neither's liein!

A' ye wha tent the gospel fauld,
There's Duncan deep, an' Peebles shaul,
But chiefly great apostle Auld,
We trust in thee,
That thou wilt work them, ho an' cauld,
Till they agree.

Consider, sirs, how we're beset;
There's scarce a new herd that we get,
But comes frae 'mang that cursed set,
I winna name;
I hope frae heav'n to see them yet
In fiery flame.

Dalrymple has been lang our fae,
M'Gill has wrought us meikle wae,
An' that curs'd rascal ca'd M'Quhae,
And baith the Shaws,
That aft hae made us black an' blae,
Wi' vengefu' paws.

Auld Wodrow lang has hatch'd mischief;
We thought aye death wad bring relief;
But he has gotten, to our grief,
Ane to succeed him,
A chield wha'll soundly buff our beef;
I meikle dread him.

And mony a ane that I could tell,
Wha fain wad openly rebel,
Forby turn-coats amang oursel',
There's Smith for ane;
I doubt he's but a greyneck still,
An' that ye'll fin'.

O! a' ye flocks o'er a, the hills,
By mosses, meadows, moors, an' fells,
Come, join your counsel and your skills
To cowe the lairds,
An' get the brutes the power themsel's
To choose their herds.

Then Orthodoxy yet may prance,
An' Learning in a woody dance,
An' that fell cur ca'd Common Sense,
That bites sae sair,
Be banished o'er the sea to France:
Let him bark there.

Then Shaw's an' D'rymple's eloquence,
M'Gill's close nervous excellence
M'Quhae's pathetic manly sense,
An' guid M'Math,
Wi' Smith, wha thro' the heart can glance,
May a' pack aff.

Ye banks, and braes, and streams around
The castle o' Montgomery!
Green be your woods, and fair your flowers,
Your waters never drumlie:
There Simmer first unfauld her robes,
And there the langest tarry;
For there I took the last Farewell
O' my sweet Highland Mary.

How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk,
How rich the hawthorn's blossom,
As underneath their fragrant shade,
I clasp'd her to my bosom!
The golden Hours on angel wings,
Flew o'er me and my Dearie;
For dear to me, as light and life,
Was my sweet Highland Mary.

Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace,
Our parting was fu' tender;
And, pledging aft to meet again,
We tore oursels asunder;
But oh! fell Death's untimely frost,
That nipt my Flower sae early!
Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay
That wraps my Highland Mary!

O pale, pale now, those rosy lips,
I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly!
And clos'd for aye, the sparkling glance
That dwalt on me sae kindly!
And mouldering now in silent dust,
That heart that lo'ed me dearly!
But still within my bosom's core
Shall live my Highland Mary.

Nae gentle dames, tho' e'er sae fair,

    Aboon the plains sae rushy, O,

Oh, were yon hills and valleys mine,
Yon palace and yon gardens fine,
The world then the love should know
I bear my Highland lassie, O.

But fickle fortune frowns on me,
And I maun cross the raging sea;
But while my crimson currents flow,
I'll love my Highland lassie, O.

Altho' thro' foreign climes I range,
I know her heart will never change,
For her bosom burns with honour's glow,
My faithful Highland lassie, O.

For her I'll dare the billows' roar,
For her I'll trace a distant shore,
That Indian wealth may lustre throw
Around my Highland lassie, O.

She has my heart, she has my hand,
by sacred truth and honour's band!
'Till the mortal stroke shall lay me low,
I'm thine, my Highland lassie, O.
    Farewell the glen sae bushy, O!
    Farewell the plain sae rushy, O!

Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
And leave auld Scotia's shore?
Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
Across th' Atlantic roar?

O sweet grows the lime and the orange,
And the apple on the pine;
But a' the charms o' the Indies
Can never equal thine.

I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary,
I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true;
And sae may the Heavens forget me,
When I forget my vow!

O plight me your faith, my Mary,
And plight me your lily-white hand;
O plight me your faith, my Mary,
Before I leave Scotia's strand.

We hae plighted our troth, my Mary,
In mutual affection to join;
And curst be the cause that shall part us!
The hour and the moment o' time!

    <title>Tam o' Shanter</title>
    <firstline>When chapmen billies leave the street</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
When chapmen billies leave the street,
And drouthy neibors, neibors meet,
As market days are wearing late,
An' folk begin to tak the gate;
While we sit bousing at the nappy,
And getting fou and unco happy,
We think na on the lang Scots miles,
The mosses, waters, slaps, and styles,
That lie between us and our hame,
Where sits our sulky sullen dame.
Gathering her brows like gathering storm,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.

This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter,
As he frae Ayr ae night did canter,
(Auld Ayr, wham ne'er a town surpasses
For honest men and bonie lasses.)

O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise,
As ta'en thy ain wife Kate's advice!
She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,
A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum;
That frae November till October,
Ae market-day thou was nae sober;
That ilka melder, wi' the miller,
Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;
That every naig was ca'd a shoe on,
The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;
That at the Lord's house, even on Sunday,
Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday.
She prophesied that late or soon,
Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon;
Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk,
By Alloway's auld haunted kirk.

Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet,
To think how mony counsels sweet,
How mony lengthen'd, sage advices,
The husband frae the wife despises!

But to our tale:-- Ae market-night,
Tam had got planted unco right;
Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,
Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely
And at his elbow, Souter Johnny,
His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony;
Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither--
They had been fou for weeks thegither!
The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter
And ay the ale was growing better:
The landlady and Tam grew gracious,
wi' favours secret, sweet and precious
The Souter tauld his queerest stories;
The landlord's laugh was ready chorus:
The storm without might rair and rustle,
Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.

Care, mad to see a man sae happy,
E'en drown'd himsel' amang the nappy!
As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,
The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure:
Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious.
O'er a' the ills o' life victorious!

But pleasures are like poppies spread,
You seize the flower, its bloom is shed;
Or like the snow falls in the river,
A moment white--then melts for ever;
Or like the borealis race,
That flit ere you can point their place;
Or like the rainbow's lovely form
Evanishing amid the storm.--
Nae man can tether time or tide;
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;
That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane,
That dreary hour he mounts his beast in;
And sic a night he taks the road in
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.

The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last;
The rattling showers rose on the blast;
The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd
Loud, deep, and lang, the thunder bellow'd:
That night, a child might understand,
The Deil had business on his hand.

Weel mounted on his gray mare, Meg--
A better never lifted leg--
Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire;
Despisin' wind and rain and fire.
Whiles holding fast his gude blue bonnet;
Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet;
Whiles glowring round wi' prudent cares,
Lest bogles catch him unawares:
Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,
Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.

By this time he was cross the ford,
Whare, in the snaw, the chapman smoor'd;
And past the birks and meikle stane,
Whare drunken Chairlie brak 's neck-bane;
And thro' the whins, and by the cairn,
Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn;
And near the thorn, aboon the well,
Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel'.--
Before him Doon pours all his floods;
The doubling storm roars thro' the woods;
The lightnings flash from pole to pole;
Near and more near the thunders roll:
When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees,
Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze;
Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing;
And loud resounded mirth and dancing.

Inspiring bold John Barleycorn!
What dangers thou canst make us scorn!
Wi' tippeny, we fear nae evil;
Wi' usquabae, we'll face the devil!--
The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle,
Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle.
But Maggie stood, right sair astonish'd,
Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd,
She ventured forward on the light;
And, vow! Tam saw an unco sight

Warlocks and witches in a dance;
Nae cotillion brent-new frae France,
But hornpipes, jigs strathspeys, and reels,
Put life and mettle in their heels.
A winnock-bunker in the east,
There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast;
A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,
To gie them music was his charge:
He scre'd the pipes and gart them skirl,
Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.--
Coffins stood round, like open presses,
That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses;
And by some develish cantraip slight,
Each in its cauld hand held a light.--
By which heroic Tam was able
To note upon the haly table,
A murders's banes in gibbet-airns;
Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns;
A thief, new-cutted frae a rape,
Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape;
Five tomahawks, wi blude red-rusted;
Five scymitars, wi' murder crusted;
A garter, which a babe had strangled;
A knife, a father's throat had mangled,
Whom his ain son o' life bereft,
The gray hairs yet stack to the heft;
Wi' mair o' horrible and awfu',
Which even to name was be unlawfu'.
Three lawyers' tongues, turn'd inside out,
Wi' lies seam'd like a beggar's clout;
Three priests' hearts, rotten, black as muck,
Lay stinking, vile in every neuk.

As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd, and curious,
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious;
The piper loud and louder blew;
The dancers quick and quicker flew;
They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit,
Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,
And coost her duddies to the wark,
And linket at it in her sark!

Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans,
A' plump and strapping in their teens,
Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen,
Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linnen!
Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,
That ance were plush, o' gude blue hair,
I wad hae gi'en them off my hurdies,
For ae blink o' the bonie burdies!

But wither'd beldams, auld and droll,
Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,
Louping and flinging on a crummock,
I wonder did na turn thy stomach!

But Tam kend what was what fu' brawlie:
There was ae winsome wench and waulie,
That night enlisted in the core,
Lang after ken'd on Carrick shore;
(For mony a beast to dead she shot,
And perish'd mony a bonie boat,
And shook baith meikle corn and bear,
And kept the country-side in fear.)
Her cutty-sark, o' Paisley harn
That while a lassie she had worn,
In longitude tho' sorely scanty,
It was her best, and she was vauntie,-
Ah! little ken'd thy reverend grannie,
That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,
Wi' twa pund Scots, ('twas a' her riches),
Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches!


But here my Muse her wing maun cour;
Sic flights are far beyond her pow'r;
To sing how Nannie lap and flang,
(A souple jade she was, and strang),
And how Tam stood, like ane bewitch'd,
And thought his very een enrich'd;
Even Satan glowr'd, and fidg'd fu' fain,
And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main;
Till first ae caper, syne anither,
Tam tint his reason a' thegither,
And roars out, "Weel done, Cutty-sark!"
And in an instant all was dark:
And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,
When out the hellish legion sallied.

As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke,
When plundering herds assail their byke;
As open pussie's mortal foes,
When, pop! she starts before their nose;
As eager runs the market-crowd,
When "Catch the thief!" resounds aloud;
So Maggie runs, the witches follow,
Wi' mony an eldritch skriech and hollo.

Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin'!
In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'!
In vain thy Kate awaits thy commin'!
Kate soon will be a woefu' woman!
Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,
And win the key-stane o' the brig;
There at them thou thy tail may toss,
A running stream they dare na cross.
But ere the key-stane she could make,
The fient a tail she had to shake!
For Nannie, far before the rest,
Hard upon noble Maggie prest,
And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle;
But little wist she Maggie's mettle -
Ae spring brought off her master hale,
But left behind her ain gray tail;
The carlin claught her by the rump,
And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.

No, wha this tale o' truth shall read,
Ilk man and mother's son take heed;
Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd,
Or cutty-sarks run in your mind,
Think! ye may buy joys o'er dear -
Remember Tam o' Shanter's mare.

<poetry>
O Mary, at thy window be,
It is the wish’d, the trysted hour;
Those smiles and glances let me see,
That make the miser’s treasure poor:
How blythely wad I bide the stoure,
A weary slave frae sun to sun;
Could I the rich reward secure,
The lovely Mary Morison!

Yestreen when to the trembling string
The dance gaed through the lighted ha’,
To thee my fancy took its wing,
I sat, but neither heard, nor saw:
Though this was fair, and that was braw,
And yon the toast of a’ the town,
I sigh’d, and said amang them a’,
‘Ye are na Mary Morison.’

O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,
Wha for thy sake wad gladly die!
Or canst thou break that heart of his,
Whase only faute is loving thee!
If love for love thou wilt na gie,
At least be pity to me shown;
A thought undgentle canna be
The thought o’ Mary Morison.

Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled,
Scots, wham Bruce has aften led,
Welcome to your gory bed,
Or to Victorie!

Now's the day, and now's the hour;
See the front o' battle lour;
See approach proud Edward's power
Chains and Slaverie!

Wha will be a traitor knave?
Wha can fill a coward's grave?
Wha sae base as be a Slave?
Let him turn and flie:

Wha, for Scotland's King and Law,
Freedom's sword will strongly draw,
Free-man stand, or Free-man fa',
Let him follow me. 				

By Oppression's woes and pains!
By your Sons in servile chains!
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free!

Lay the proud Usurpers low!
Tyrants fall in every foe!
Liberty's in every blow!
Let us Do—or Die!!!

<poetry>
Inhuman man! curse on thy barb'rous art,
And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye;
May never pity soothe thee with a sigh,
Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart!

Go live, poor wand'rer of the wood and field!
The bitter little that of life remains:
No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains
To thee a home, or food, or pastime yield.

Seek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,
No more of rest, but now thy dying bed!
The sheltering rushes whistling o'er thy head,
The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest.

Perhaps a mother's anguish adds its woe;
The playful pair crowd fondly by thy side;
Ah! helpless nurslings, who will now provide
That life a mother only can bestow!

Oft as by winding Nith I, musing, wait
The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn,
I'll miss thee sporting o'er the dewy lawn,
And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.

Oh, open the door, some pity to shew,

Oh, open the door to me, oh.

Cauld is the blast upon my pale cheek,
But caulder thy love for me, oh:
The frost that freezes the life at my heart,
Is nought to my pains frae thee, oh.

The wan Moon is setting beyond the white wave,
And Time is setting with me, oh:
False friends, false love, farewell! for mair
I'll ne'er trouble them, nor thee, oh.

She has open'd the door, she has open'd it wide,
She sees the pale corse on the plain, oh:
“My true love!” she cried, and sank down by his side,
Never to rise again, oh.

Here Stuarts once in glory reigned,
And laws for Scotland's weal ordained;
But now unroof'd their palace stands,
Their sceptre's sway'd by other hands;
Fallen indeed, and to the earth
Whence groveling reptiles take their birth.
The injured Stuart line is gone,
A race outlandish fills their throne;
An idiot race, to honour lost;
Who know them best despise them most.

<body>
O lassie, art thou sleeping yet,
Or are you waking, I wou'd wit?
For love has bound me hand and foot,
And I wou'd fain be in, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

The morn it is the term-day,
I maun away, I canna stay :
O pity me, before I gay,
And rise and let me in, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

The night it is baith cauld and weet,
The morn it will be snaw and sleet,
My shoen are frozen to my feet
Wi' standing on the plain, jo.

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

I am the laird of windy-was,
I come na here without a cause,
And I hae gotten mony fa's
Upon a naked wame o!

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

My father's wa'king on the street,
My mither the chamber-keys does keep,
My chamber-door does chirp and cheep,
And I dare nae let you in, jo!

O gae your way this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night
O gae your way this ae night, for I dare nae let you in, jo!

But I'll come stealing saftly in
And cannily make little dinn,
And then the gate to you I'll find,
If you'l but direct me in, jo!

O let me in this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O let me in this ae night, and I'll ne'er come back again, jo.

Cast aff the shoen frae aff your feet,
Cast back the door up to the weet,
Syne into my bed you may creep
And do the thing you ken, jo.

O well's on me this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O well's on me this ae night, that ere I let you in, jo!

She let him in sae cannily,
She let him in sae privily,
She let him in sae cannily,
To do the thing ye ken, jo.

O well's on me this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O well's on me this ae night, that ere I let you in, jo!

But ere a' was done and a' was said,
Out fell the bottom of the bed,
The lassie lost her maidenhead,
And her mither heard the din, jo.

O the devil take this ae night, this ae, ae, ae night,
O the devil take this ae night, that ere I let ye in, jo!

What can a young lassie, what shall a young lassie,
What can a young lassie do wi' an auld man?
Bad luck on the pennie, that tempted my Minnie 
To sell her poor Jenny for siller and lan'!

He's always compleenin frae morning to e'enin,
He hosts and he hirpls the weary day lang:
He's doyl't and he's dozin, his blude it is frozen.
O, dreary's the night wi' a crazy auld man!

He hums and he hankers, he frets and he cankers,
I never can please him do a' that I can;
He's peevish, and jealous of a' the young fellows,
O, dool on the day I met wi' an auld man!

My auld auntie Katie upon me taks pity,
I'll do my endeavour to follow her plan;
I'll cross him, and wrack him until I heartbreak him,
And then his auld brass will buy me a new pan.

There lived a carl in Kellyburn Braes, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
And he had a wife was the plague o' his days, 
And the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime; 
[And he had a wife was the plague o' his days, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.]

Ae day as the carl gaed up the lang-glen, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
He met with the devil, says, how do you fen? 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

I've got a bad wife, Sir, that's a' my complaint, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
For, savin your presence, to her ye're a saint,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

It's neither your stot nor your staig I shall crave, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
But gie me your wife, man, for her I must have,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

O, welcome most kindly! the blythe carl said; 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
But if ye can match her - ye're waur than ye're ca'd,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil has got the auld wife on his back, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
And like a poor pedlar he's carried his pack, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

He's carried her hame to his ain hallan-door, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
Syne bade her gae in, for a bitch, and a whore, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

Then straight he makes fifty, the pick o' his band, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
Turn out on her guard in the clap of a hand, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The carlin gaed thro' them like ony wud bear, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
Whae'er she gat hands on, cam near her nae mair, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

A reekit wee devil looks over the wa', 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
O help, Master, help! or she'll ruin us a', 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil he swore by the edge o' his knife, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
He pitied the man that was ty'd to a wife, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

The devil he swore by the kirk and the bell, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
He was not in wedlock, thank Heav'n, but in hell, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

Then Satan has travell'd again wi' his pack, 
Hey and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
And to her auld husband he's carried her back, 
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.

I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life, 
Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; 
But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.
[But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,
And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime.]

   <firstline>O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell, 
Who, as it pleases best Thysel', 
Sends ane to heaven an' ten to hell, 
A' for Thy glory, 
And no for ony gude or ill 
They've done afore Thee! 

I bless and praise Thy matchless might, 
When thousands Thou hast left in night, 
That I am here afore Thy sight, 
For gifts an' grace 
A burning and a shining light 
To a' this place. 

What was I, or my generation, 
That I should get sic exaltation, 
I wha deserve most just damnation 
For broken laws, 
Five thousand years ere my creation, 
Thro' Adam's cause? 

When frae my mither's womb I fell, 
Thou might hae plunged me in hell, 
To gnash my gums, to weep and wail, 
In burnin lakes, 
Where damned devils roar and yell, 
Chain'd to their stakes. 

Yet I am here a chosen sample, 
To show thy grace is great and ample; 
I'm here a pillar o' Thy temple, 
Strong as a rock, 
A guide, a buckler, and example, 
To a' Thy flock. 

O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear, 
When drinkers drink, an' swearers swear, 
An' singin there, an' dancin here, 
Wi' great and sma'; 
For I am keepit by Thy fear 
Free frae them a'. 

But yet, O Lord! confess I must, 
At times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust: 
An' sometimes, too, in wardly trust, 
Vile self gets in: 
But Thou remembers we are dust, 
Defil'd wi' sin. 

O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg - 
Thy pardon I sincerely beg, 
O! may't ne'er be a livin plague 
To my dishonour, 
An' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg 
Again upon her. 

Besides, I farther maun avow, 
Wi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow - 
But Lord, that Friday I was fou, 
When I cam near her; 
Or else, Thou kens, Thy servant true 
Wad never steer her. 

Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn 
Buffet Thy servant e'en and morn, 
Lest he owre proud and high shou'd turn, 
That he's sae gifted: 
If sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne, 
Until Thou lift it. 

Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place, 
For here Thou hast a chosen race: 
But God confound their stubborn face, 
An' blast their name, 
Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace 
An' public shame. 

Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts; 
He drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes, 
Yet has sae mony takin arts, 
Wi' great and sma', 
Frae God's ain priest the people's hearts 
He steals awa. 

An' when we chasten'd him therefor, 
Thou kens how he bred sic a splore, 
An' set the warld in a roar 
O' laughing at us; - 
Curse Thou his basket and his store, 
Kail an' potatoes. 

Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r, 
Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr; 
Thy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare 
Upo' their heads; 
Lord visit them, an' dinna spare, 
For their misdeeds. 

O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken, 
My vera heart and flesh are quakin, 
To think how we stood sweatin', shakin, 
An' piss'd wi' dread, 
While he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin, 
Held up his head. 

Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him, 
Lord, visit them wha did employ him, 
And pass not in Thy mercy by 'em, 
Nor hear their pray'r, 
But for Thy people's sake, destroy 'em, 
An' dinna spare. 

But, Lord, remember me an' mine 
Wi' mercies temp'ral an' divine, 
That I for grace an' gear may shine, 
Excell'd by nane, 
And a' the glory shall be thine, 
Amen, Amen!

   <title>Man Was Made To Mourn</title>
   <firstline>When chill November's surly blast</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
When chill November's surly blast 
Made fields and forests bare, 
One ev'ning, as I wander'd forth 
Along the banks of Ayr, 
I spied a man, whose aged step 
Seem'd weary, worn with care; 
His face was furrow'd o'er with years, 
And hoary was his hair. 

"Young stranger, whither wand'rest thou?" 
Began the rev'rend sage; 
"Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain, 
Or youthful pleasure's rage? 
Or haply, prest with cares and woes, 
Too soon thou hast began 
To wander forth, with me to mourn 
The miseries of man. 

"The sun that overhangs yon moors, 
Out-spreading far and wide, 
Where hundreds labour to support 
A haughty lordling's pride; - 
I've seen yon weary winter-sun 
Twice forty times return; 
And ev'ry time has added proofs, 
That man was made to mourn. 

"O man! while in thy early years, 
How prodigal of time! 
Mis-spending all thy precious hours- 
Thy glorious, youthful prime! 
Alternate follies take the sway; 
Licentious passions burn; 
Which tenfold force gives Nature's law. 
That man was made to mourn. 

"Look not alone on youthful prime, 
Or manhood's active might; 
Man then is useful to his kind, 
Supported in his right: 
But see him on the edge of life, 
With cares and sorrows worn; 
Then Age and Want - oh! ill-match'd pair - 
Shew man was made to mourn. 

"A few seem favourites of fate, 
In pleasure's lap carest; 
Yet, think not all the rich and great 
Are likewise truly blest: 
But oh! what crowds in ev'ry land, 
All wretched and forlorn, 
Thro' weary life this lesson learn, 
That man was made to mourn. 

"Many and sharp the num'rous ills 
Inwoven with our frame! 
More pointed still we make ourselves, 
Regret, remorse, and shame! 
And man, whose heav'n-erected face 
The smiles of love adorn, - 
Man's inhumanity to man 
Makes countless thousands mourn! 

"See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight, 
So abject, mean, and vile, 
Who begs a brother of the earth 
To give him leave to toil; 
And see his lordly fellow-worm 
The poor petition spurn, 
Unmindful, tho' a weeping wife 
And helpless offspring mourn. 

"If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave, 
By Nature's law design'd, 
Why was an independent wish 
E'er planted in my mind? 
If not, why am I subject to 
His cruelty, or scorn? 
Or why has man the will and pow'r 
To make his fellow mourn? 

"Yet, let not this too much, my son, 
Disturb thy youthful breast: 
This partial view of human-kind 
Is surely not the last! 
The poor, oppressed, honest man 
Had never, sure, been born, 
Had there not been some recompense 
To comfort those that mourn! 

"O Death! the poor man's dearest friend, 
The kindest and the best! 
Welcome the hour my aged limbs 
Are laid with thee at rest! 
The great, the wealthy fear thy blow 
From pomp and pleasure torn; 
But, oh! a blest relief for those 
That weary-laden mourn!"

Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray,
       That lov'st to greet the early morn,
Again thou usherast in the day
       My Mary from my soul was torn.
O Mary, dear departed shade
       Where is thy place of blissful rest?
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

That sacred hour can I forget?
       Can I forget the hallow'd grove
Where, by the winding Ayr, we met,
       To live one day of parting love?
Eternity cannot efface
       Those records dear of transports past,
Thy image at our last embrace---
       Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore,
       O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green;
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar,
       Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene;
The flowers sprang wanton to be prest
       The birds sang love on every spray
Till too, too soon, the glowing west,
       Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.

Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes,
       And fondly broods with miser-care;
Time but th' impression stronger makes,
       As streams their channels deeper wear.
O Mary! dear departed shade!
       Where is thy place of blissful rest?
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid?
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
   And never brought to min'?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
   And days o' lang syne?
 
We twa hae rin about the braes,
   And pu'd the gowans fine;<note><i>gowans</i>: daisies.</note>
But we've wander'd monie a weary fit<note><i>fit</i>: foot.</note>
   Sin' auld lang syne.
 
We twa hae paidl't i' the burn,
   Frae mornin' sun till dine;<note><i>dine</i>: dinner-time.</note>
But seas between us braid hae roar'd
   Sin' auld lang syne.
 
And here 's a hand, my trusty fiere,<note><i>fiere</i>: partner.</note>
   And gie's a hand o' thine;
And we'll tak a right guid-willie waught<note><i>guid-willie waught</i>: friendly draught.</note>
   For auld lang syne.
 
And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,
   And surely I'll be mine;
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
   For auld lang syne!
 
      For auld lang syne, my dear,
         For auld lang syne,
      We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
         For auld lang syne.

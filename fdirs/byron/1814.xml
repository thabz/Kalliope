The chain I gave was fair to view,
    The lute I added sweet in sound,
The heart that offered both was true,
    And ill deserv'd the fate it found.

<nonum><center><i>2.</i></center></nonum>
These gifts were charm'd by secret spell
    Thy truth in absence to divine;
And they have done their duty well,
    Alas! they could not teach thee thine.

<nonum><center><i>3.</i></center></nonum>
That chain was firm in every link.
    But not to bear a stranger's touch;
That lute was sweet—till thou could'st think
    In other hands ts notes were such.

<nonum><center><i>4.</i></center></nonum>
Let him, who from thy neck unbound
    The chain which shiver'd in his grasp,
Who saw that lute refuse to sound,
    Restring the chords, renew the clasp.

<nonum><center><i>5.</i></center></nonum>
When thou wert chang'd, they alter'd too;
    The chain is broke, the music mute:
'Tis past—to them and thee adieu—
    False heart, frail chain, and silent lute.

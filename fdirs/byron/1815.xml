     She walks in beauty like the night
     Of cloudless climes and starry skies,
     And all that's best of dark and bright
     Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
     Thus mellowed to the tender light
     Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

     One ray the more, one shade the less
     Had half impaired the nameless grace
     Which waves in every raven tress
     Or softly lightens o'er her face,
     Where thoughts serenely sweet express
     How pure, how dear their dwelling place.

     And on that cheek and o'er that brow
     So soft, so calm yet eloquent,
     The smiles that win, the tints that glow
     But tell of days in goodness spent
     A mind at peace with all below,
     A heart whose love is innocent.

     The harp the monarch minstrel swept,
         The King of men, the loved of Heaven,
     Which Music hallow'd while she wept
         O'er tones her heart of hearts had given,
         Redoubled be her tears, its chords are riven!
     It soften'd men of iron mould,
         It gave them virtues not their own;
     No ear so dull, no soul so cold,
         That felt not, fired not to the tone,
         Till David's lyre grew mightier than his throne!

     It told the triumphs of our King,
         It wafted glory to our God;
     It made our gladden'd valleys ring,
         The cedars bow, the mountains nod;
         Its sound aspired to heaven and there abode!
     Since then, though heard on earth no more,
         Devotion and her daughter Love
     Still bid the bursting spirit soar
         To sounds that seem as from above,
         In dreams that day's broad light can not remove.

     If that high world, which lies beyond

     To soar from earth and find all fears
         Lost in thy light - Eternity!

     It must be so: 'tis not for self
         That we so tremble on the brink;
     And striving to o'erleap the gulf,
         Yet cling to Being's severing link.
     Oh! in that future let us think
         To hold each heart the heart that shares;
     With them the immortal waters drink,
         And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!

     The wild gazelle on Judah's hills,
         Exulting yet may bound,
     And drink from all the living rills
         That gush on holy ground:
     Its airy step and glorious eye
     May glance in tameless transport by.: -

     A step as fleet, an eye more bright,
         Hath Judah witness'd there;
     And o'er her scenes of lost delight
         Inhabitants more fair,
     The cedars wave on Lebanon,
     But Judah's statelier maids are gone!

     More blest each palm that shades those plains
         Than Israel's scatter'd race:
     For, taking root, it there remains
         In solitary grace:
     It cannot quit the place of birth,
     It will not live in other earth.

     But we must wander witheringly,
               In other lands to die;
     And where our fathers' ashes be,
         Our own may never lie:
     Our temple hath not left a stone.
     And Mockery sits on Salem's throne.

     Thy glory shrouded in its garb of fire:
     Thyself - none living see and not expire!

     Since our Country, our God - Oh, my Sire!
     Demand that thy Daughter expire;

     And the voice of my mourning is o'er,
     And the mountains behold me no more:
     If the hand that I love lay me low,
     There cannot be pain in the blow!

     And of this, oh, my Father! be sure -
     That the blood of thy child is as pure
     As the blessing I beg ere it flow,
     And the last thought that soothes me below.

     Though the virgins of Salem lament,
     Be the judge and the hero unbent!
     I have won the great battle for thee,
     And my Father and Country are free!

     When this blood of thy giving hath gush'd,
     When the voice that thou lovest is hush'd,
     Let my memory still be thy pride,
     And forget not I smiled as I died!

     And feed deep thought with many a dream,

         Fond wretch! as if her step disturb'd the dead!

     Away! we know that tears are vain,
         That death nor heeds nor hears distress:
     Will this unteach us to complain?
         Or make one mourner weep the less?

     I saw thee smile - the sapphire's blaze

     It could not match the living rays

     As clouds from yonder sun receive
         A deep and mellow dye,
     Which scarce the shade of coming eve

     Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
         Their own pure joy impart;
     Their sunshine leaves a glow behind

     And gentle winds and waters near,

     Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
     And in the sky the stars are met,
     And on the wave is deeper blue,
     And on the leaf a browner hue,
     And in the Heaven that clear obscure
     So softly dark, and darkly pure,
     That follows the decline of day
     As twilight melts beneath the moon away.

     And ye, oh her desolate daughters!

     The King was on his throne,
         The Satraps throng'd the hall:
     A thousand bright lamps shone
         O'er that high festival.
     A thousand cups of gold,
         In Judah deem'd divine -
     Jehovah's vessels hold
         The godless Heathen's wine!

     In that same hour and hall,
         The fingers of a hand
     Came forth against the wall,
         And wrote as if on sand:
     The fingers of a man; -
         A solitary hand
     Along the letters ran,
         And traced them like a wand.

     The monarch saw, and shook,
         And bade no more rejoice;
     All bloodless wax'd his look
         And tremulous his voice.
     'Let the men of lore appear,
         The wisest of the earth,
     And expound the words of fear,
         Which mar our royal mirth.'

     Chaldea's seers are good,
         But here they have no skill;
     And the unknown letters stood
         Untold and awful still.
     And Babel's men of age
         Are wise and deep in lore;
     But now they were not sage,
         They saw - but knew no more.

     A captive in the land,
         A stranger and a youth,
     He heard the king's command,
         He saw that writing's truth.
     The lamps around were bright,
         The prophecy in view;
     He read it on that night, -
         The morrow proved it true.

     'Belshazzar's grave is made,
         His kingdom pass'd away,
     He, in the balance weigh'd,
         Is light and worthless clay;
     The shroud his robe of state,
         His canopy the stone:
     The Mede is at his gate!
         The Persian on his throne!'

     Oh, Maramne! where art thou?

     Ah! could'st thou - thou would'st pardon now,
         Though Heaven were to my prayer unheeding.

     And is she dead? - and did they dare

     The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
     And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
     And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
     When the blue wave rolls nightly on the Galilee.

     Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,
     That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
     Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,
     That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

     For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
     And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
     And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
     And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still!

     And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
     But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
     And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
     And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

     And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
     With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
     And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
     The lances unlifted, the trumpets unblown.

     And the widows of Ashur are load in thier wail,
     And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;

         Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
         Bid the prophet's form appear.
         'Samuel, raise thy buried head!
         King, behold the phantom seer!'

     Earth yawn'd; he stood the centre of a cloud:
     Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
     Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye:
     His hand was withere'd, and his veins were dry;
     His foot, in bony whiteness, glitter'd there,
     Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;
     From lips that moved not and unbreathing frame,
     Like cavern'd winds, the hollow accents came.
     Saul saw, and fell to earth, as falls the oak,
     At once, and blasted by the thunderstroke.

         'Why is my sleep disquieted?
         Who is he that calls the dead?
         Is it thou, O King? Behold,
         Bloodless are these limbs, and cold:
         Such are mine; and such shall be
         Thine to-morrow, when with me:
         Ere the coming day is done,
         Such shalt thou be, such thy son.
         Fare thee well, bur for a day,
         Then we mix our mouldering clay.
         Thou, thy race, lie pale and low,
         Pierced by shafts of many a bow;
         And the falchion by thy side
         To thy heart thy hand shall guide:
         Crownless, breathless, headless fall,
         Son and sire, the house of Saul!'

     When coldness wraps this suffering clay,
         Ah! whither strays the immortal mind?
     It cannot die, it cannot stay,
         But leaves its darken'd dust behind.
     Then, unembodied, doth it trace
         By steps each planet's heavenly way?
     Or fill at once the realms of space,
         A thing of eyes, that all survey?

     Eternal, boundless, undecay'd,
         A thought unseen, but seeing all,
     All, all in earth or skies display'd,
         Shall it survey, shall it recall:
     Each fainter trace that memory holds
         So darkly of departed years,
     In one broad glance the soul beholds,
         And all, that was, at once appears.

     Before Creation peopled earth,
         Its eye shall roll through chaos back;
     And where the farthest heaven had birth,
         The spirit trace its rising track.
     And where the future mars or makes,
         Its glance dilate o'er all to be,
     While sun is quench'd or system breaks,
         Fix'd in its own eternity.

     Above or Love, Hope, Hate, or Fear,
         It lives all passionless and pure:
     An age shall fleet like earthly year;
         Its years as moments shall endure.
     Away, away, without a wing,
         O'er all, through all, its thought shall fly,
     A nameless and eternal thing,
         Forgetting what it was to die.

     Fame, wisdom, love, and power were mine,
         And health and youth possess'd me;
     My goblets blush'd from every vine,
         And lovely forms carress'd me;
     I sunn'd my heart in beauty's eyes,
         And felt my soul grow tender;
     All earth can give, or mortal prize,
         Was mine of regal splendour.

     I strive to number o'er what days
         Remembrance can discover,
     Which all that life or earth displays
         Would lure me to live over.
     There rose no day, there roll'd no hour
         Of pleasure unembitter'd:
     And not a trapping deck'd my power
         That gall'd not while it glitter'd.

     The serpent of the field, by art
         And spells, is won from harming;
     But that which coils around the heart,
         Oh! who hath power of charming?
     It will not list to wisdom's lore,
         Nor music's voice can lure it;
     But there it stings for evermore
         The soul that must endure it.

<body>
     From the last hill that looks on thy once holy dome,
     I beheld thee, oh Sion! when render'd to Rome:
     'Twas thy last sun went down, and the flames of thy fall
     Flash'd back on the last glance I gave to thy wall.

     I look'd for thy temple, I look'd for my home,
     And forgot for a moment my bondage to come;
     I beheld but the death-fire that fed on thy fane,
     And the fast-fetter'd hands that made vengeance in vain.

     Oh many an eve, the high spot whence I gazed
     Had reflected the last beam of day as it blazed;
     While I stood on the height, and beheld the decline
     Of the rays from the mountain that shone on thy shrine.

     And now on that mountain I stood on that day,
     But I mark'd not the twilight beam melting away;
     Oh! would that the lightning had glared in its stead,
     And the thunderbolt burst on the conqueror's head!

     But the gods of the Pagan shall never profane
     The shrine where Jehovah disdain'd not to reign;
     And scatter'd and scorn'd as thy people may be,
     Our worship, oh Father! is only for thee.

     Francisca walks in the shadow of night,
     But it is not to gaze on the heavenly light -
     But if she sits in her garden bower,
     'Tis not for the sake of its blowing flower.
     She listens - but not for the nightingale -
     Though her ear expects as soft a tale.
     There winds a step through the foliage thick,
     And her cheek grows pale, and her heart beats quick.
     There whispers a voice thro' the rustling leaves;
     A moment more and they shall meet -
     'Tis past - her lover's at her feet.

     Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
     Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,

     How like art thou to joy remember'd well!

     So gleams the past, the light of other days,
     Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays;
     A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
     Distinct but distant - clear - but, oh how cold!

     Bright be the place of thy soul!
         No lovelier spirit than thine
     E'er burst from its mortal control,
         In the orbs of the blessed to shine.
     On earth thou wert all but divine,
         As thy soul shall immortally be;
     And our sorrow may cease to repine
         When we know that thy God is with thee.

     Light be the turf of thy tomb!
         May its verdure like emeralds be!
     There should not be the shadow of gloom
         In aught that reminds us of thee.
     Young flowers and an evergreen tree
         May spring from the spot of thy rest:
     But not cypress not yew let us see;
         For why should we mourn for the blest?

     I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,
     There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame;
     But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart
     The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.

     Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace,
     Were those hours - can their joy or their bitterness cease?
     We repent, we abjure, we will break from our chain, -
     We will part, we will fly to - unite it again!

     Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt!
     Forgive me, adored one! - forsake, if thou wilt: -
     But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased,
     And man shall not break it - whatever thou mayst.

     And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
     This soul, in its bitterest blackness, shall be;
     And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
     With thee by my side than with worlds at our feet.

     One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,
     Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove;
     And the heartless may wonder at all I resign -
     Thy lip shall reply, not to them, but to mine.

     In the valley of the waters we wept o'er the day
     When the host of the stranger made Salem his prey,
     And our heads on our bosoms all droopingly lay,
     And our hearts were so full of the land far away.

     The song they demanded in vain - it lay still
     In our souls as the wind that died on the hill;
     They called for the harp - but our blood they shall spill
     Ere our right hand shall teach them one tone of our skill.

     All stringlessly hung on the willow's sad tree,
     As dead as her dead leaf those mute harps must be;
     Our hands may be fetter'd - our tears still are free,
     For our God and our glory - and, Sion ! - Oh, thee.

     Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;

     'Is man more just that God? Is man more pure
     Than he who deems even Seraphs insecure?
     Creatures of clay - vain dwellers in the dust!
     The moth survives you, and are ye more just?

     They say that Hope is happiness;

     And Memory wakes the thoughts that bless:
         They rose the first - they set the last;

     And all that Memory loves the most
         Was once our only Hope to be,
     And all that Hope adored and lost
         Hath melted into Memory.

     Alas it is delusion all:
         The future cheats us from afar,
     Nor can we be what we recall,

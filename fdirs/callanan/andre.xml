   <title>Serenade</title>
   <firstline>The blue waves are sleeping</firstline>
</head>
<body>
The blue waves are sleeping;
  The breezes are still;
The light dews are weeping
  Soft tears On the hill;
The moon in mild beauty,
  Looks bright from above;
Then come to the casement,
  Oh <sc>Mary</sc> my love.

Not a sound, or a motion
   Is over the lake,
But the whisper of ripples,
  As shoreward they break;
My skiff wakes no ruffle
  The waters among,
Then listen dear maid
  To thy true lover's song.

No form from the lattice
  Did ever recline,
Over Italy's waters,
  More lovely than thine;
Then come to the window
  And shed from above,
One glance of thy dark eye,
  One smile of thy love.

Oh! the soul of that eye
  When it breaks from its shroud,
Shines beauteously but,
  Like the Moon from a cloud;
And thy whisper of love
  Breathed thus from afar,
Is sweeter to me
  Than the sweetest guitar.

From the storms of this world
  How gladly I'd fly,
To the calm of that breast,
  To the heaven of that eye;
How deeply I love thee
  'Twere useless to tell;
Farewell then my dear one,
  My <sc>Mary</sc>, farewell.

    <title>The Outlaw of Loch Lene</title>
    <firstline>O many a day have I made good ale in the glen</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<sc>O many</sc> a day have I made good ale in the glen,
That came not of stream or malt, like the brewing of men:
My bed was the ground; my roof, the green-wood above;
And the wealth that I sought, one far kind glance from my Love.

Alas! on that night when the horses I drove from the field,
That I was not near from terror my angel to shield!
She stretch'd forth her arms; her mantle she flung to the wind,
And swam o'er Loch Lene, her outlaw'd lover to find.

O would that a freezing sleet-wing'd tempest did sweep,
And I and my love were alone, far off on the deep;
I'd ask not a ship, or a bark, or a pinnace, to save—
With her hand round my waist, I'd fear not the wind or the wave.

'Tis down by the lake where the wild tree fringes its sides,
The maid of my heart, my fair one of Heaven resides:
I think, as at eve she wanders its mazes among,
The birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song.

    <title>The Night was Still</title>
    <firstline>The night was still,—the air was balm</firstline>
</head>
<body>
The night was still,—the air was balm,
  Soft dews around were weeping; 
No whisper rose o'er ocean's calm, 
   Its waves in light were sleeping, 
With <sc>Mary</sc> on the beach I stray'd; 
  The stars beam'd joy above me; 
I prest her hand and said, “sweet maid 
  “Oh tell me do you love me?”

With modest air she diooped her head,
  Her cheek of beauty veiling; 
Her bosom heav'd.—no word she said;
  I mark'd her strife of feeling; 
“Oh speak mv doom dear maid,” I cried,
  “By yon bright Heaven above thee;” 
She gently raised her eyes and sighed,
  “Too well you know I love thee.”

<poetry>
I love the stillness of the wood:
   I love the music of the rill:
I love to couch in pensive mood
   Upon some silent hill.

Scarce heard, beneath you arching trees,
   The silver-crested ripples pass;
And, like a mimic brook, the breeze
   Whispers among the grass.

Here from the world I win release,
   Nor scorn of men, nor footstep rude,
Break in to mar the holy peace
   Of this great solitude.

Here may the silent tears I weep
   Lull the vexed spirit into rest,
As infants sob themselves to sleep
   Upon a mother's breast.

But when the bitter hour is gone,
   And the keen throbbing pangs are still,
Oh, sweetest then to couch alone
   Upon some silent hill!

To live in joys that once have been,
   To put the cold world out of sight,
And deck life's drear and barren scene
   With hues of rainbow-light.

For what to man the gift of breath,
   If sorrow be his lot below;
If all the day that ends in death
   Be dark with clouds of woe?

Shall the poor transport of an hour
   Repay long years of sore distress -
The fragrance of a lonely flower
   Make glad the wilderness?

Ye golden hours of Life's young spring,
   Of innocence, of love and truth!
Bright, beyond all imagining,
   Thou fairy-dream of youth!

I'd give all wealth that years have piled,
   The slow result of Life's decay,
To be once more a little child
   For one bright summer-day.

<poetry>
The morn was bright, the steeds were light,
   The wedding guests were gay:
Young Ellen stood within the wood
   And watched them pass away.
She scarcely saw the gallant train:
   The tear-drop dimmed her e'er:
Unheard the maiden did complain
   Beneath the Willow-Tree.

,,Oh, Robin, thou didst love me well,
   Till, on a bitter day,
She came, the Lady Isabel,
   And stole thy heart away.
My tears are vain: I live again
   In days that used to be,
When I could meet they welcome feet
   Beneath the Willow-Tree.

,,Oh, Willow gray, I may not stay
   Till Spring renew thy leaf;
But I will hide myself away,
   And nurse a lonely grief.
It shall not dim Life's joy for him:
   My tears he shall not see:
While he is by, I'll come not nigh
   My weeping Willow-Tree.

,,But when I die, oh, let me lie
   Beneath thy loving shade,
That he may loiter careless by,
   Where I am lowly laid.
And let the white white marble tell,
   If he should stoop to see,
'Here lies a maid that loved thee well,
   Beneath the Willow-tree.' ''

<poetry>
The night creeps onward, sad and slow:
In these red embers' dying glow
The forms of Fancy come and go.

An island-farm - broad seas of corn
Stirred by the wandering breath of morn -
The happy spot where I was born.

The picture fadeth in its place:
Amid the glow I seem to trace
The shifting semblance of a face.

'Tis now a little childish form -
Red lips for kisses pouted warm -
And elf-locks tangled in the storm.

'Tis now a grave and gentle maid,
At her own beauty half afraid,
Shrinking, and willing to be stayed.

Oh, Time was young, and Life was warm,
When first I saw that fairy-form,
Her dark hair tossing in the storm.

And fast and free these pulses played,
When last I met that gentle maid -
When last her hand in mine was laid.

Those locks of jet are turned to gray,
And she is strange and far away
That might have been mine own to-day -

That might have been mine own, my dear,
Through many and many a happy year -
That might have sat beside me here.

Ay, changeless through the changing scene,
The ghostly whisper rings between,
The dark refrain of ,,might have been''.

The race is o'er I might have run:
The deeds are past I might have done;
And sere the wreath I might have won.

Sunk is the last faint flickering blaze:
The vision of departed days
Is vanished even as I gaze.

The pictures, with their ruddy light,
Are changed to dust and ashes white,
And I am left alone with night.

Our Latin books, in motley row,
   Invite us to our task -
Gay Horace, stately Cicero:
Yet there's one verb, when once we know,
   No higher skill we ask:
This ranks all other lore above -
We've learned ,,'<i>Amare</i>' means '<i>to love</i>'<i>!</i>''

Sp, hour by hour, from flower to flower,
   We sip the sweets of Life:
Till, all too soon, the clouds arise,
And flaming cheeks and flashing eyes
   Proclaim the dawn of strife:
With half a smile and half a sigh,
,,<i>Amare! Bitter One!</i>'' we cry.

Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,
   ,,Too well the scholar knows
There is no rose without a thorn'' -
But peace is made! We sing, this morn,
   ,,No thorn without a rose!''
Our Latin lesson is complete:
We've learned that Love is Bitter-Sweet!

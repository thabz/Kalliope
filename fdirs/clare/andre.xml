Oh, the world is all too rude for thee, with much ado and care;
Oh, this world is but a rude world, and hurts a thing so fair;
Was there a nook in which the world had never been to sear,
That place would prove a paradise when thou and Love were near.

And there to pluck the blackberry, and there to reach the sloe,
How joyously and happily would Love thy partner go;
Then rest when weary on a bank, where not a grassy blade
Had e’er been bent by Trouble’s feet, and Love thy pillow made.

For Summer would be ever green, though sloes were in their prime,
And Winter smile his frowns to Spring, in beauty’s happy clime;
And months would come, and months would go, and all in sunny mood,
And everything inspired by thee grow beautifully good.

And there to make a cot unknown to any care and pain,
And there to shut the door alone on singing wind and rain--
Far, far away from all the world, more rude than rain or wind,
Oh who could wish a sweeter home, or better place to find?

Than thus to love and live with thee, thou beautiful delight!
Than thus to live and love with thee the summer day and night!
The Earth itself, where thou hadst rest, would surely smile to see
Herself grow Eden once again, possest of Love and thee.

    <title>My Early Home</title>
    <firstline>Here sparrows build upon the trees</firstline>

<poetry>
Here sparrows build upon the trees,
        And stockdove hides her nest;
The leaves are winnowed by the breeze
        Into a calmer rest;
The black-cap’s song was very sweet,
        That used the rose to kiss;
It made the Paradise complete:
        My early home was this.

The redbreast from the sweetbriar bush
        Dropt down to pick the worm;
On the horse-chesnut sang the thrush,
        O’er the house where I was born;
The moonlight, like a shower of pearls,
        Fell o’er this “bower of bliss,”
And on the bench sat boys and girls:
        My early home was this.

The old house stooped just like a cave,
        Thatched o’er with mosses green;
Winter around the walls would rave,
        But all was calm within;
The trees are here all green agen,
        Here bees the flowers still kiss,
But flowers and trees seemed sweeter then:
        My early home was this.

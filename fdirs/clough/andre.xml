<poetry>
Whate'er you dream, with doubt possessed, 
Keep, keep it snug within your breast, 
And lay you down and take your rest; 
And when you wake, to work again, 
The wind it blows, the vessel goes, 
And where and whither, no one knows.

'Twill all be well: no need of care; 
Though how it will, and when, and where, 
We cannot see, and can't declare. 
In spite of dreams, in spite of thought, 
'Tis not in vain, and not for nought, 
The wind it blows, the ship it goes, 
Though where and whither, no one knows

<body>
Is my lover on the sea
Sailing east or sailing west,
Mighty ocean, gentle be,
Rock him into rest.

Let no angry wind arise
Nor a wave with whitened crest,
All be gentle as his eyes
When he is caressed.

Bear him as the breeze above
Bears the bird unto his nest,
There unto his home of love
And there bid him rest.

<body>
Spirit of the summer breeze! 
Wherefore sleep'st thou in the trees? 
Come, and kiss the maiden rose, 
That on Marian's bosom blows! 

Come, and fawn about her hair! 
  Kiss the fringes of her eyes! 

Ask her why she looks so fair, 
  When she heedeth not my sighs? 

Tell her, murmuring summer air, 
  That her beauty's all untrue; 

Tell her, she should not seem fair, 
  Unless she be gentle too!

<body>
Drink, and fill the night with mirth! 
  Let us have a mighty measure, 
Till we quite forget the earth, 
  And soar into the world of pleasure. 
Drink, and let a health go round, 
  (Tis the drinker's noble duty,) 
To the eyes that shine and wound, 
  To the mouths that bud in beauty! 

Here's to Helen! Why, ah! why 
  Doth she fly from my pursuing? 
Here's to Marian, cold and shy! 
  May she warm before thy wooing! 
Here's to Janet! I've been e'er, 
  Boy and man, her staunch defender, 
Always sworn that she was fair, 
  Always known that she was tender! 
  
Fill the deep-mouthed glasses high! 
  Let them with the champaign tremble, 
Like the loose wrack in the sky, 
  When the four wild winds assemble! 
Here's to all the love on earth, 
  (Love, the young man's, wise man's, treasure!) 
Drink, and fill your throats with mirth! 
  Drink, and drown the world in pleasure!

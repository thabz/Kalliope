<body>
Is my lover on the sea
Sailing east or sailing west,
Mighty ocean, gentle be,
Rock him into rest.

Let no angry wind arise
Nor a wave with whitened crest,
All be gentle as his eyes
When he is caressed.

Bear him as the breeze above
Bears the bird unto his nest,
There unto his home of love
And there bid him rest.

<sc>Spirit</sc> of the summer breeze!
Wherefore sleep'st thou in the trees?
Come, and kiss the maiden rose,
That on Marian's bosom blows!

Come, and fawn about her hair!
  Kiss the fringes of her eyes!
Ask her why she looks so fair,
  When she heedeth not my sighs?

Tell her, murmuring summer air,
  That her beauty's all untrue;
Tell her, she should not seem fair,
  Unless she be gentle too!

Drink, and fill the night with mirth!
  Let us have a mighty measure,
Till we quite forget the earth,
  And soar into the world of pleasure.
Drink, and let a health go round,
  (Tis the drinker's noble duty,)
To the eyes that shine and wound,
  To the mouths that bud in beauty!

Here's to Helen! Why, ah! why
  Doth she fly from my pursuing?
Here's to Marian, cold and shy!
  May she warm before thy wooing!
Here's to Janet! I've been e'er,
  Boy and man, her staunch defender,
Always sworn that she was fair,
  Always known that she was tender!

Fill the deep-mouthed glasses high!
  Let them with the champaign tremble,
Like the loose wrack in the sky,
  When the four wild winds assemble!
Here's to all the love on earth,
  (Love, the young man's, wise man's, treasure!)
Drink, and fill your throats with mirth!
  Drink, and drown the world in pleasure!

    <title>Indian Love</title>
    <firstline>Tell me not that thou dost love me</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Tell me not that thou dost love me,
Though it thrill me with delight:
Thou art, like the stars, above me;
I — the lowly earth, at night.

Hast thou ( thou from kings descended)
Loved the Indian cottage-born;
And shall she, whom Love befriended,
Darken all thy hopeful morn?

Go, — and, for thy father's glory,
Wed the blood that's pure and free:
'Tis enough to gild my story
That I once was loved by thee!

    <title>Marcelia</title>
    <firstline>It was a dreary place. The shallow brook</firstline>
</head>
<body>
— —<sc>It</sc> was a dreary place. The shallow brook
That ran throughout the wood, there took a turn
And widen'd: all its music died away,
And in the place a silent eddy told
That there the stream grew deeper. There dark trees
Funereal (cypress, yew, and shadowy pine,
And spicy cedar) cluster'd, and at night
Shook from their melancholy branches sounds
And sighs like death: 't was strange, for through the day
They stood quite motionless, and look'd methought
Like monumental things, which the sad earth
From its green bosom had cast out in pity,
To mark a young girl's grave. The very leaves
Disown'd their natural green, and took a black
And mournful hue: and the rough brier, stretching
His straggling arms across the rivulet,
Lay like an armed sentinel there, catching
With his tenacious leaf, straws, wither'd boughs,
Moss that the banks had lost, coarse grasses which
Swam with the current, and with these it hid
The poor Marcelia's death-bed.— —Never may net
Of venturous fisher be cast in with hope,
For not a fish abides there. The slim deer
Snorts as he ruffles with his shorten’d breath
The brook, and panting flies the unholy place,
And the white heifer lows and passes on;
The foaming hound laps not, and winter birds
Go higher up the stream. And yet I love
To loiter there: and when the rising moon
Flames down the avenue of pines, and looks
Red and dilated through the evening mists,
And chequer'd as the heavy branches sway
To and fro with the wind, I stay to listen,
And fancy to myself that a sad voice,
Praying, comes moaning through the leaves, as 't were
For some misdeed. The story goes that some
Neglected girl (an Orphan, whom the world
Frown'd upon) once stray'd thither, and 't was thought
Cast herself in the stream. You may have heard
Of one Marcelia, poor Molini's daughter, who
Fell ill and came to want? No? oh she loved
A wealthy man who mark'd her not. He wed,
And then the girl grew sick and pined away,
And drown'd herself for love. Some day or other
I'll tell you all the story.

    <title>The Recall</title>
    <firstline>Come again! Come again!</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<sc>Come</sc> again! Come again!
Sunshine cometh after rain.
As a lamp fed newly burneth,
Pleasure, who doth fly, returneth,
Scattering every cloud of pain.
As the year, which dies in showers,
Riseth in a world of flowers,
Called by many a vernal strain,
Come <i>thou</i>, for whom tears were falling,
And a thousand tongues are calling!
Come again, O come again!
Like the sunshine after rain!

    <title>Softly Woo Away Her Breath</title>
    <firstline>Softly woo away her breath</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Softly woo away her breath, 
  Gentle Death! 
Let her leave thee with no strife, 
  Tender, mournful, murmuring Life! 
She hath seen her happy day: 
  She hath had her bud and blossom : 
Now she pales and shrinks away, 
  Earth, into thy gentle bosom! 

She hath done her bidding here, 
  Angels dear! 
Bear her perfect soul above, 
  Seraph of the skies, sweet Love! 
Good she was, and fair in youth, 
  And her mind was seen to soar, 
And her heart was wed to truth: 
  Take her, then, for evermore, 
For ever-evermore!

<body>
Is my lover on the sea
Sailing east or sailing west,
Mighty ocean, gentle be,
Rock him into rest.

Let no angry wind arise
Nor a wave with whitened crest,
All be gentle as his eyes
When he is caressed.

Bear him as the breeze above
Bears the bird unto his nest,
There unto his home of love
And there bid him rest.

<body>
Spirit of the summer breeze! 
Wherefore sleep'st thou in the trees? 
Come, and kiss the maiden rose, 
That on Marian's bosom blows! 

Come, and fawn about her hair! 
  Kiss the fringes of her eyes! 

Ask her why she looks so fair, 
  When she heedeth not my sighs? 

Tell her, murmuring summer air, 
  That her beauty's all untrue; 

Tell her, she should not seem fair, 
  Unless she be gentle too!

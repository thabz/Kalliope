      <note>Teksten følger <i>The Poems of William Cowper</i>, red. John D. Baird &amp; Charles Ryskamp, 3 bind, Clarendon Press 1997, bind 1, s. 139-206.</note>
      <note>De 66 salmer er i originaludgaven organiseret efter tema og blandet sammen med salmer af John Newton som også stod bag udgivelsen af <i>Olney Hymns</i>. "Hymn 33" er udeladt med vilje da den fejlagtigt er tillagt Cowper, og de to sidste salmer i samlingen er ikke nummererede fordi de ikke klarerede cuttet til <i>Olney Hymns</i> og først blev udgivet posthumt. </note>

Oh for a closer Walk with God,
    A calm and heav'nly Frame;
<i>A Light to shine upon the Road
    That leads me to the Lamb!</i>

Where is the Blessedness I knew
    When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the Soul-refreshing View
    Of Jesus and his Word?

What peacefull Hours I then enjoy'd,
    How sweet their Mem'ry still!
But they have left an Aching Void
    The World can never fill.

Return, oh Holy Dove, Return,
    Sweet Messenger of Rest,
I hate the Sins that made thee mourn
    And drove thee from my Breast.

The dearest Idol I have known,
    Whate'ver that Idol be,
Help me to tear it from Thy Throne,
    And worship Only Thee.

Then shall my Walk be close with God,
    Calm and serene my Frame,
The purer Light shall mark the Road
    That leads me to the Lamb.

The saints should never be dismay'd,
    Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For when they least expect his aid,
    The Saviour will appear.

This Abraham found, he rais'd the knife,
    <sc>God</sc> saw, and said, ,,Forbear;''
Yon ram shall yield his meaner life,
    Behold the victim there.

Once David seem'd Saul's certain prey;
    But hark! the foe's at hand;
Saul turns his arms another way,
    To save th'invaded land.

When Jonah sunk beneath the wave
    He thought to rise no more;
But <sc>God</sc> prepar'd a fish to save,
    And bear him to the shore.

Blest proofs of pow'r and grace divine,
    That meet us in his word!
May ev'ry deep-felt care of mine
    Be trusted with the <sc>Lord</sc>.

Wait for his seasonable aid,
    And tho' it tarry wait:
The promise may be long delay'd,
    But cannot come too late.

Heal us, <sc>Emmanuel</sc>, here we are,
    Waiting to feel thy touch;
Deep-wounded souls to thee repair,
    And, Saviour, we are such.

Our faith is feeble we confess,
    We faintly trust thy word;
But wilt thou pity us the less?
    Be that far from thee, <sc>Lord</sc>!

Remember him who once apply'd
    With trembling for relief;
,,<sc>Lord</sc>, I believe, with tears he cry'd,
    O help my unbelief.''

She too, who touch'd thee in the press,
    And healing virtue stole;
Was answer'd, ,,Daughter, go in peace,
    Thy faith hath made thee whole.''

Conceal'd amid the gath'ring throng,
    She would have shun'd thy view;
And if her faith was firm and strong,
    Had strong misgivings too.

Like her, with hopes and fears, we come,
    To touch thee if we may;
Oh! send us not despairing home,
    Send none unheal'd away.

    By whom was David taught,
        To aim the dreadful blow,
    When he Goliath fought,
        And laid the Gittite low?
No sword nor spear the stripling took,
But chose a pebble from the brook.

    'Twas Israel's <sc>God</sc> and king,
        Who sent him to the fight;
    who gave him strength to sling,
        And skill to aim aright.
Ye feeble saints your strength endures,
Because young David's <sc>God</sc> is yours.

    Who ordered Gideon forth,
        To storm th'invaders' camp,
    With arms of little worth,
        A pitcher and a lamp?
The trumpets made his coming known,
And all the host was overthrown.

    Oh! I have seen the day,
        When with a single word,
    <sc>God</sc> helping me to say,
        My trust is in the <sc>Lord</sc>;
My soul has quell'd a thousand foes,
Fearless of all that could oppose.

    But unbelief, self-will,
        Self-righteousness and pride,
    How often do they steal,
        My weapon from my side?
Yet David's <sc>Lord</sc>, and Gideon's friend,
Will help his servant to the end.

<sc>Jesus</sc>, whose blood so freely stream'd
To satisfy the law's demand;
By thee from guilt and wrath redeem'd,
Before the Father's face I stand.

To reconcile offending man,
Make Justice drop her angry rod;
What creature could have form'd the plan,
Or who fulfil it but a <sc>God</sc>?

No drop remains of all the curse,
For wretches who deserv'd the whole;
No arrows dipt in wrath to pierce
The guilty, but returning soul.

Peace by such means so dearly bought,
What rebel could have hop'd to see?
Peace, by his injur'd sovereign wrought,
His Sov'reign fastned to the tree.

Now, <sc>Lord</sc>, thy feeble worm prepare!
For strife with earth and hell begins;
Confirm and gird me for the war,
They hate the soul that hates his sins.

Let them in horrid league agree!
They may assault, they may distress;
But cannot quench thy love to me,
Nor rob me of the <sc>Lord</sc> my peace.

<body>
Ere <sc>GOD</sc> had built the mountains,
Or rais'd the fruitful hills;
Before he fill'd the fountains
That feed the running rills;
In me, from everlasting,
The wonderful <sc>I AM</sc>
Found pleasures never wasting,
And Wisdom is my name.

When, like a tent to dwell in,
He spread the skies abroad;
And swath'd about the swelling
Of ocean's mighty flood;
He wrought by weight and measure,
And I was with him then;
Myself the Father's pleasure,
And mine, the sons of men.

Thus wisdom's words discover
Thy glory and thy grace,
Thou everlasting lover
Of our unworthy race!
Thy gracious eye survey'd us
Ere stars were seen above;
In wisdom thou hast made us,
And dy'd for us in love.

And couldst thou be delighted
With creatures such as we!
Who when we saw thee, slighted
And nail'd thee to a tree?
Unfathomable wonder,
And mystery divine!
The voice that speaks in thunder,
Says, ,,Sinner I am thine!''

<body>
<sc>God</sc> gives his mercies to be spent;
Your hoard will do your soul no good:
Gold is a blessing only lent,
Repaid by giving others food.

The world's esteem is but a bribe,
To buy their peace you sell your own;
The slave of a vain-glorious tribe,
Who hate you while they make you known.

The joy that vain amusements give,
Oh! sad conclusion that it brings!
The honey of a crowded hive,
Defended by a thousand stings.

'Tis thus the world rewards the fools
That live upon her treach'rous smiles;
She leads them, blindfold, by her rules,
And ruins all whom she beguiles.

<sc>God</sc> knows the thousands who go down
From pleasure, into endless woe;
And with a long despairing grone
Blaspheme their Maker as they go.

O fearful thought! be timely wise;
Delight but in a Saviour's charms;
And <sc>God</sc> shall take you to the skies,
Embrac'd in everlasting arms.

Streams of life, a plenteous store,
And my soul shall thirst no more.

<sc>Jesus</sc> is become at length
My salvation and my strength;
And his praises shall prolong,
While I live, my pleasant song.

Praise ye, then, his glorious name,
Publish his exalted fame!
Still his worth your praise exceeds,
Excellent are all his deeds.

Raise again the joyful sound,
Let the nations roll it round!

The <sc>Lord</sc> will happiness divine
    On contrite hearts bestow:
Then tell me, gracious <sc>God</sc>, is mine
    A contrite heart, or no?

I hear, but seem to hear in vain,
    Insensible as steel;
If ought is felt, 'tis only pain,
    To find I cannot feel.

I sometimes think myself inclin'd
    To love thee, if I could;
But often feel another mind,
    Averse to all that's good.

My best desires are faint and few,
    I fain would strive for more;
But when I cry, ,,My strength renew,''
    Seem weaker than before.

Thy saints are comforted I know
    And love thy house of pray'r;
I therefore go where others go,
    But find no comfort there.

O make this heart rejoice, or ach;
    Decide this doubt for me;
And if it be not broken, break,
    And heal it, if it be.

Thorns of heart-felt tribulation

You shall name your walls, Salvation,
And your gates shall all be praise.

Then, like streams that feed the garden,
Pleasures, without end, shall flow;
For the <sc>Lord</sc>, your faith rewarding,
All his bounty shall bestow:
Still in undisturb'd possession,
Peace and righteousness shall reign;
Never shall you feel oppression,
Hear the voice of war again.

You no more your suns descending,
Waning moons no more shall see;
But your griefs, for ever ending,
Find eternal noon in me;
<sc>God</sc> shall rise, and shining o'er you,
Change to day the gloom of night;
He, the <sc>Lord</sc>, shall be your glory,

My <sc>God</sc>! how perfect are thy ways!

Sin twines itself about my praise,

When I would speak what thou hast done
    To save me from my sin;
I cannot make thy mercies known
    But self-applause creeps in.

Divine desire, that holy flame
    Thy grace creates in me;
Alas! impatience is its name,
    When it returns to thee.

This heart, a fountain of vile thoughts,
    How does it overflow?
While self upon the surface floats
    Still bubbling from below.

Let others in the gaudy dress
    Of fancied merit shine;
The <sc>Lord</sc> shall be my righteousness,

My <sc>God</sc>! till I receiv'd thy stroke,

So unaccustom'd to the yoke,

With grief my just reproach I bear,
    Shame fills me at the thought;
How frequent my rebellions were!
    What wickedness I wrought!

Thy merciful restraint I scorn'd
    And left the pleasant road;
Yet turn me, and I shall be turn'd,

Is Ephraim banish'd from my thoughts,

No, saith the <sc>Lord</sc>, with all his faults,

Is he a dear and pleasant child?
    Yes, dear and pleasant still;
Tho' sin his foolish heart beguil'd,
    And he withstood my will.

My sharp rebuke has laid him low,
    He seeks my face again;
My pity kindles at his woe,

As birds their infant brood protect,
And spread their wings to shelter them;
Thus saith the <sc>Lord</sc> to his elect,
,,So will I guard Jerusalem.''

And what then is Jerusalem,
This darling object of his care?
Where is its worth in <sc>God</sc>'s esteem?
Who built it? who inhabits there?

<sc>Jehovah</sc> founded it in blood,
The blood of his incarnate Son;
There dwell the saints, once foes to <sc>God</sc>,
The sinners, whom he calls his own.

There, tho' besieg'd on ev'ry side,
Yet much belov'd and guarded well;
From age to age they have defy'd,
The utmost force of earth and hell.

Let earth repent, and hell despair,
This city has a sure defence;
Her name is call'd, the <sc>Lord</sc> is there,
And who has pow'r to drive him thence.

There is a fountain fill'd with blood

Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream

Then in a nobler sweeter song
    I'll sing thy power to save;
When this poor lisping stamm'ring tongue

Ye sons of earth prepare the plough,
    Break up your fallow ground!
The Sower is gone forth to sow,
    And scatter blessings round.

The seed that finds a stony soil,
    Shoots forth a hasty blade;
But ill repays the sower's toil,
    Soon wither'd, scorch'd, and dead.

The thorny ground is sure to baulk
    All hopes of harvest there;
We find a tall and sickly stalk,
    But not the fruitful ear.

The beaten path and high-way side
    Receive the trust in vain;
The watchful birds the spoil divide,
    And pick up all the grain.

But where the <sc>Lord</sc> of grace and pow'r
    Has bless'd the happy field;
How plenteous is the golden store
    The deep-wrought furrows yield!

Father of mercies, we have need
    Of thy preparing grace;
Let the same hand that give me seed,
    Provide a fruitful place.

Thy mansion is the christian's heart,
O <sc>Lord</sc>, thy dwelling place secure!
Bid the unruly throng depart,
And leave the consecrated door.

Devoted as it is to thee,
A thievish swarm frequents the place;
They steal away my joys from me,
And rob my Saviour of his praise.

There too a sharp designing trade
Sin, Satan, and the world maintain;
Nor cease to press me, and persuade,
To part with ease and purchase pain.

I know them, and I hate their din,
And weary of the bustling crowd;
But while their voice is heard within,
I cannot serve thee as I would.

Oh! for the joy thy presence gives,
What peace shall reign when thou art here!
Thy presence makes this den of thieves,
A calm delightful house of pray'r.

And if thou make thy temple shine,
Yet self-abas'd, will I adore;
The gold and silver are not mine,
I give thee what was thine before.

Hark, my soul! it is the <sc>Lord</sc>;
'Tis Thy Saviour, hear His word;
<sc>Jesus</sc> speaks, and speaks to thee,
,,Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?

I deliver'd thee when bound,
And, when wounded, heal'd thy wound;
Sought thee wand'ring, set thee right,
Turn'd thy darkness into light.

Can a woman's tender care
Cease, towards the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.

Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above;
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.

Thou shalt see my glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of my throne shalt be,
Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou me?''

<sc>Lord</sc>, it is my chief complaint,
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love thee and adore,
Oh for grace to love thee more!

Fierce passions discompose the mind,
    As tempests vex the sea;
But calm content and peace we find,
    When, <sc>Lord</sc>, we turn to thee.

In vain by reason and by rule,
    We try to bend the will;
For none, but in the Saviour's school
    Can learn the heav'nly skill.

Since at his feet my soul has sat,
    His gracious words to hear;
Contented with my present state,
    I cast, on him, my care.

,,Art thou a sinner, soul?'' He said,
    ,,Then how canst thou complain?
How light thy troubles here, if weigh'd
    With everlasting pain!

If thou of murmuring wouldst be cur'd,
    Compare thy griefs with mine;
Think what my love for thee endur'd,
    And thou wilt not repine.

'Tis I appoint thy daily lot,
    And I do all things well:
Thou soon shalt leave this wretched spot,
    And rise with me to dwell.

In life my grace shall strength supply,
    Proportion'd to thy day;
At death thou still shalt find me nigh,
    To wipe thy tears away.''

Thus I who once my wretched days,
    In vain repinings spent;
Taught in my Saviour's school of grace,
    Have learn'd to be content.

    Israel in ancient days
    Not only had a view
    Of Sinai in a blaze,
    But learn'd the gospel too:
The types and figures were a glass
In which they saw a Saviour's face.

    The paschal sacrifice,
    And blood-besprinkled door,
    Seen with enlightened eyes,
    And once apply'd with pow'r;
Would teach the need of other blood,
To reconcile an angry <sc>God</sc>.

    The Lamb, the Dove, set forth
    His perfect innocence,
    Whose blood of matchless worth,
    Should be the soul's defence:
For he who can for sin atone,
Must have no failings of his own.

    The scape-goat on his head
    The people's trespass bore,
    And to the desert led,
    Was to be seen no more:
In him, our Surety seem'd to say,
,,Behold, I bear your sins away.''

    Dipt in his fellow's blood,
    The living bird went free,
    The type, well understood,
    Express'd the sinner's plea;
Describ'd a guilty soul enlarg'd,
And by a Saviour's death discharg'd.

    <sc>Jesus</sc>, I love to trace
    Throughout the sacred page;
    The footsteps of thy grace,
    The same in ev'ry age!
O grant that I may faithful be
To clearer light, vouchsaf'd to me.

All thy works and ways I search,
Find thy zeal and love decay'd;
Thou art call'd a living church,

    Watch, remember, seek, and strive,
        Exert thy former pains;
    Let thy timely care revive,
        And strengthen what remains:
Cleanse thine heart, thy works amend,
Former times to mind recall:
Lest my sudden stroke descend,
        And smite thee once for all.

    Yet I number now in thee,
        A few that are upright;
    These my Father's face shall see,
        And walk with me in white:
When in judgment I appear,
They for mine shall be confest;
Let my faithful servants hear,

Bestow, dear <sc>Lord</sc>, upon our youth,
    The gift of saving grace;
And let the seed of sacred truth
    Fall in a fruitful place.

Grace is a plant, where'er it grows,
    Of pure and heav'nly root;
But fairest in the youngest shews,
    And yields the sweetest fruit.

Ye careless ones, O hear betimes
    The voice of sovereign love!
Your youth is stain'd with many crimes,
    But mercy reigns above.

True, you are young, but there's a stone
    Within the youngest breast;
Or half the crimes which you have done
    Would rob you of your rest.

For you the public pray'r is made,
    Oh! join the public pray'r!
For you the secret tear is shed,
    O shed yourselves a tear.

We pray that you may early prove
    The Spirit's power to teach;
You cannot be too young to love
    That <sc>Jesus</sc> whom we preach.

What various hind'rances we meet
In coming to a mercy-seat!
Yet who that knows the worth of pray'r,
But wishes to be often there.

Pray'r makes the dark'ned cloud withdraw,
Pray'r climbs the ladder Jacob saw;
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings ev'ry blessing from above.

Restraining pray'r, we cease to fight;
Pray'r makes the christian's armor bright;
And Satan trembles, when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.

While Moses stood with arms spread wide,
Success was found on Israel's side;
But when thro' weariness they fail'd,
That moment Amalek prevail'd.

Have you no words? ah, think again,
Words flow apace when you complain;
And fill your fellow-creature's ear
With the sad tale of all your care.

Were half the breath thus vainly spent,
To heav'n in supplication sent;
Your cheerful song would oft'ner be,
,,Hear what the <sc>Lord</sc> has done for me!''

And works his Sovereign Will.

Ye fearfull Saints fresh courage take,
The clouds ye so much dread,
Are big with Mercy, and shall break

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust him for his Grace,
Behind a frowning Providence
He hides a Smiling face.

His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour,
The Bud may have a bitter taste,
But <i>wait</i>, to <i>Smell the flower</i>.

Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan his work in vain,
God is his own Interpreter,
And he will make it plain.

Did I meet no trials here,

I think upon it all the day.

What are the mines of shining wealth,
The strength of youth, the bloom of health!
What are all joys compar'd with those
Thine everlasting word bestows!

Long unafflicted, undismay'd,
In pleasure's path secure I stray'd;
Thou mad'st me feel thy chastning rod,
And straight I turn'd unto my <sc>God</sc>.

What tho' it pierc'd my fainting heart,
I bless thine hand that caus'd the smart;
It taught my tears awhile to flow,
But sav'd me from eternal woe.

Oh! hadst thou left me unchastis'd,
Thy precepts I had still despis'd;
And <i>still</i> the snare in secret laid,
Had my unwary feet betray'd.

I love thee therefore O my <sc>God</sc>,
And breathe towards thy dear abode;
Where in thy presence fully blest,
Thy chosen saints for ever rest.

The billows swell, the winds are high,
Clouds overcast my wintry sky;
Out of the depths to thee I call,
My fears are great, my strength is small.

O <sc>Lord</sc>, the pilot's part perform,
And guide and guard me thro' the storm;
Defend me from each threatning ill,
Controll the waves, say, ,,Peace, be still.''

Amidst the roaring of the sea,
My soul still hangs her hope on thee,
Thy constant love, thy faithful care,
Is all that saves me from despair.

Dangers of ev'ry shape and name
Attend the follow'rs of the Lamb,
Who leave the world's deceitful shore,
And leave it to return no more.

Tho' tempest-toss'd and half a wreck,
My Saviour thro' the floods I seek;
Let neither winds nor stormy main,
Force back my shatter'd bark again.

Afflicted at thy feet I fall;
When the great water-floods prevail,
Leave not my trembling heart to fail!

Friend of the friendless, and the faint!
Where should I lodge my deep complaint?
Where but with thee, whose open door
Invites the helpless and the poor!

Did ever mourner plead with thee,
And thou refuse the mourner's plea?
Does not the word still fix'd remain,
That none shall seek thy face in vain?

That were a grief I could not bear,
Didst thou not hear and answer pray'r;
But a pray'r-hearing, answ'ring <sc>God</sc>,
Supports me under ev'ry load.

Fair is the lot that's cast for me!
I have an advocate with thee;
They whom the world caresses most,
Have no such privilege to boast.

Poor tho' I am, despis'd, forgot,
Yet <sc>God</sc>, my <sc>God</sc>, forgets me not;

My soul is sad and much dismay'd;
See, <sc>Lord</sc>, what legions of my foes,
With fierce Apollyon at their head,
My heav'nly pilgrimage oppose!

See, from the ever-burning lake
How like a smoky cloud they rise!
With horrid blasts my soul they shake,
With storms of blasphemies and lies.

Their fiery arrows reach the mark,
My throbbing heart with anguish tear;
Each lights upon a kindred spark,
And finds abundant fuel there.

I hate the thought that wrongs the <sc>Lord</sc>;
Oh, I would drive it from my breast,
With thy own sharp two-edged sword,

When darkness long has veil'd my mind,
And smiling day once more appears;
Then, my Redeemer, then I find
The folly of my doubts and fears.

Straight I upbraid my wand'ring heart,
And blush that I should ever be
Thus prone to act so base a part,
Or harbour one hard thought of thee!

Oh! let me then at length be taught
What I am still so slow to learn;
That <sc>God</sc> is love, and changes not,
Nor knows the shadow of a turn.

Sweet truth, and easy to repeat!
But when my faith is sharply try'd,
I find myself a learner yet,
Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide.

But, O my <sc>Lord</sc>, one look from thee
Subdues the disobedient will;
Drives doubt and discontent away,
And thy rebellious worm is still.

Thou art as ready to forgive
As I am ready to repine;
Thou, therefore, all the praise receive,
Be shame, and self-abhorrence, mine.

Renew'd supplies of pard'ning grace,

    What glories shine in him,
Pant for his presence, as the roe

They cleave to ev'ry thing I do,
    And swim before my eyes.

How toilsome then to sing and pray,

    Of all the truths I hear
    How few delight my taste!
I glean a berry here and there,
    But mourn the vintage past.

    Yet let me (as I ought)
    Still hope to be supply'd;
No pleasure else is worth a thought,
    Nor shall I be deny'd.

The <sc>Lord</sc> will my desire perform,

Dear <sc>Lord</sc> accept a sinful heart,

And mourns, with much and frequent smart,

There fiery seeds of anger lurk,
    Which often hurt my frame;
And wait but for the tempter's work,

Legality holds out a bribe
    To purchase life from thee;
And discontent would fain prescribe
    How thou shalt deal with me.

While unbelief withstands thy grace,
    And puts the mercy by;
Presumption, with a brow of brass,
    Says, ,,Give me, or I die.''

How eager are my thoughts to roam
    In quest of what they love!
But ah! when duty calls them home,
    How heavily they move!

Oh, cleanse me in a Saviour's blood,

And make me thy belov'd abode,

Help me with patience to endure.

Why should th'unburnt, tho' burning bush,

Man should not faint at thy rebuke,

When the curst thing that Achan took,
Brought Israel into just disgrace.

Self-righteousness, provokes the rod.

Of Satan's dark domain;
Feels a new empire form'd within,
And owns a heav'nly reign.

Nor less to praise him when he grants

My lab'ring spirit vainly seeks
    To tell but half the joy;
With how much tenderness he speaks,
    And helps me to reply.

Nor were it wise, nor should I choose

Like precious wines their taste they lose

But this with boldness I proclaim,
    Nor care if thousands hear;
Sweet is the ointment of his name,
    Not life is half so dear.

And can you frown, my former friends,
    Who knew what once I was;
And blame the song that thus commends
    The man who bore the cross?

Trust me, I draw the likeness true,

Such honor may he give to you,

Beneath the spreading heavens,

And he who feeds the ravens,
    Will give his children bread.

Then all my servile works were done

Holy <sc>Lord</sc> <sc>God</sc>! I love thy truth,
Nor dare thy least commandment slight;
Yet pierc'd by sin, the serpent's tooth,
I mourn the anguish of the bite.

But tho' the poison lurks within,
Hope bids me still with patience wait;
Till death shall set me free from sin,
Free from the only thing I hate.

Had I a throne above the rest,
Where angels and archangels dwell;
One sin, unslain, within my breast,
Would make that heav'n as dark as hell.

The pris'ner, sent to breathe fresh air,
And bless'd with liberty again,
Would mourn, were he condemn'd to wear
One link of all his former chain.

But oh! no foe invades the bliss,
When glory crowns the christian's head;
One view of <sc>Jesus</sc> as he is,
Will strike all sin for ever dead.

The new-born child of gospel-grace,
Like some fair tree when summer's nigh,
Beneath <sc>Emmanuel's</sc> shining face,
Lifts up his blooming branch on high.

No fears he feels, he sees no foes,
No conflict yet his faith employs,
Nor has he learnt to whom he owes,
The strength and peace his soul enjoys.

But sin soon darts its cruel sting,
And, comforts sinking day by day,
What seem'd his own, a self-fed spring,
Proves but a brook that glides away.

When Gideon arm'd his num'rous host,
The <sc>Lord</sc> soon made his numbers less;
And said, lest Israel vainly boast,
,,My arm procur'd me this success.''

Thus will he bring our spirits down,
And draw our ebbing comforts low;
That sav'd by grace, but not our own,
We may not claim the praise we owe.

O <sc>God</sc>, whose favorable eye
    The sin-sick soul revives;
Holy and heav'nly is the joy
    Thy shining presence gives.

Not such as hypocrites suppose,
    Who with a graceless heart,
Taste not of thee, but drink a dose
    Prepar'd by Satan's art.

Intoxicating joys are theirs,
    Who while they boast their light,
And seem to soar above the stars,
    Are plunging into night.

Lull'd in a soft and fatal sleep,
    They sin, and yet rejoice;
Were they indeed the Saviour's sheep,
    Would they not hear his voice?

Be mine the comforts, that reclaim
    The soul from Satan's pow'r;
That make me blush for what I am,
    And hate my sin the more.

'Tis joy enough, my All in All,
    At thy dear feet to lie;
Thou wilt not let me lower fall,
    And none can higher fly.

The <sc>Lord</sc> receives his highest praise,
From humble minds and hearts sincere;
While all the loud professor says,
Offends the righteous Judge's ear.

To walk as children of the day,
To mark the precepts' holy light;
To wage the warfare, watch, and pray,
Shew who are pleasing in his sight.

Not words alone it cost the <sc>Lord</sc>,
To purchase pardon for his own;
Nor will a soul, by grace restor'd
Return the Saviour words alone.

With golden bells, the priestly vest,
And rich pomegranates border'd round,
The need of holiness express'd,
And call'd for fruit, as well as sound.

Easy, indeed, it were to reach
A mansion in the courts above,
If swelling words, and fluent speech
Might serve, instead of faith and love.

But none shall gain the blissful place,
Or <sc>God</sc>'s unclouded glory see;
Who talks of free and sov'reign grace,
Unless that grace has made <i>him</i> free.

Too many <sc>Lord</sc>, abuse thy grace
    In this Licentious Day,
And while they boast they see thy Face,
    They turn their Own away.

Thy Book displays a gracious Light,
    That can the Blind restore,
But These are dazzled by the Sight,
    And Blinded still the more.

The Pardon such presume upon,
    They do not Beg but Steal,
And when they plead it at thy Throne,
    Oh, where's the Gospel's Seal?

Was it for This, ye Lawless Tribe,
    The dear Redeemer Bled?
Is This the grace the Saints imbibe
    From Christ the Living Head?

Oh <sc>Lord</sc>! we know thy Chosen Few,
    Are fed with heav'nly Fare,
But These - the wretched Husks they chew,
    Proclaim them what they are.

The Liberty our Hearts implore,
    Is, not to Live in Sin,
But still to wait at Wisdom's Door,
    Till Mercy calls us in.

What thousands never knew the road!
What thousands hate it when 'tis known!
None but the chosen tribes of <sc>God</sc>,
Will seek or choose it for their own.

A thousand ways in ruin end,
One, only, leads to joys on high;
By that my willing steps ascend,
Pleased with a journey to the sky.

No more I ask, or hope to find,
Delight or happiness below;
Sorrow may well possess the mind
That feeds where thorns and thistles grow.

The joy that fades is not for me,
I seek immortal joys above;
There, glory without end, shall be
The bright reward of faith and love.

Cleave to the world ye sordid worms,
Contented lick your native dust;
But <sc>God</sc> shall fight, with all his storms,
Against the idol of your trust.

    To keep the lamp alive
    With oil we fill the bowl;
'Tis water makes the willow thrive,
    And grace that feeds the soul.

    The <sc>Lord</sc>'s unsparing hand
    Supplies the living stream;
It is not at our own command,
    But still deriv'd from him.

    Beware of Peter's word,
    Nor confidently say,
,,I never <i>will</i> deny thee, <sc>Lord</sc>,''
    But grant I never <i>may</i>.

    Man's wisdom is to seek
    His strength in <sc>God</sc> alone;
And e'en an angel would be weak,
    Who trusted in his own.

    Retreat beneath his wings,
    And in his grace confide;
This more exalts the King of kings
    Than all your works beside.

    In <sc>Jesus</sc> is our store,
    Grace issues from his throne;
Whoever says, ,,I want no more,''
    Confesses he has none.

Grace, triumphant in the throne,
Scorns a rival, reigns alone!
Come and bow beneath her sway,
Cast your idol works away:
Works of man, when made his plea,
Never shall accepted be;
Fruits of pride (vain-glorious worm)
Are the best he can perform.

Self, the god his soul adores,
Influences all his pow'rs;
<sc>Jesus</sc> is a slighted name,
Self-advancement all his aim:
But when <sc>God</sc> the Judge shall come,
To pronounce the final doom;
Then for rocks and hills to hide
All his works and all his pride.

Still the boasting heart replies,
What! the worthy and the wise,
Friends to temperance and peace,
Have not these a righteousness?
Banish ev'ry vain pretence
Built on human excellence;
Perish ev'ry thing in man,
But the grace that never can.

Of all the gifts thine hand bestows,
    Thou Giver of all good!
Not heav'n itself a richer knows,
    Than my Redeemer's blood.

Faith too, the blood-receiving grace,
    From the same hand we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
    That gift had been in vain.

Till thou thy teaching pow'r apply,
    Our hearts refuse to see;
And weak, as a distemper'd eye,
    Shut out the view of thee.

Blind to the merits of thy Son,
    What mis'ry we endure!
Yet fly that hand, from which alone,
    We could expect a cure.

We praise thee, and would praise thee more,
    To thee our all we owe;
The precious Saviour, and the pow'r
    That makes him precious too.

Almighty King! whose wond'rous hand,
Supports the weight of sea and land;
Whose grace is such a boundless store,
No heart shall break that sighs for more.

Thy Providence supplies my food,
And 'tis thy blessing makes it good;
My soul is nourish'd by thy word,
Let soul and body praise the <sc>Lord</sc>.

My streams of outward comfort came
From him, who built this earthly frame;
Whate'er I want his bounty gives,
By whom my soul for ever lives.

Either his hand preserves from pain,
Or, if I feel it, heals again;
From Satan's malice shields my breast,
Or overrules it for the best.

Forgive the song that falls so low
Beneath the gratitude I owe!
It means thy praise, however poor,
An angel's song can do no more.

Winter has a joy for me,
While the Saviour's charms I read,
Lowly, meek, from blemish free,
In the snow-drop's pensive head.

Spring returns, and brings along
Life-invigorating suns:
Hark! the turtle's plaintive song,
Seems to speak his dying grones!

Summer has a thousand charms,
All expressive of his worth;
'Tis his sun that lights and warms,
His the air that cools the earth.

What! has autumn left to say
Nothing, of a Saviour's grace?
Yes, the beams of milder day
Tell me of his smiling face.

Light appears with early dawn;
While the sun makes haste to rise,
See his bleeding beauties, drawn
On the blushes of the skies.

Ev'ning, with a silent pace,
Slowly moving in the west,
Shews an emblem of his grace,
Points to an eternal rest.

Lord! I love the Habitation
    Where the Saviour's Honour dwells,
At the Sound of thy Salvation
    With Delight my Bosom swells.
Grace Divine how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace that I have found.

Me thro' Waves of deep Affiiction
    Dearest Saviour! thou hast brought,
Fiery Deeps of sharp Conviction
    Hard to bear and passing Thought.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the grace which makes me thine.

From the cheerful Beams of Morning
    Sad I turn'd mine Eyes away:
And the Shades of Night returning
    Fill'd my Soul with new Dismay.
Grace Divine how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace that I have found.

Food I loath'd nor ever tasted
    But by Violence constrain'd,
Strength decay'd and Body wasted,
    Spoke the Terrors I sustain'd.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the grace which make me thine.

Bound and watch'd lest Life abhorring
    I should my own Death procure,
For to me the Pit of Roaring
    Seem'd more easy to endure.
Grace Divine how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace which I have found.

Fear of Thee with gloomy Sadness,
    Overwhelm'd thy guilty Worm,
'Till reduced to moping Madness,
    Reason sunk beneath the Storm.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the grace which makes me thine.

Then what Soul distressing Noises
    Seem'd to reach me from below,
Visionary Scenes and Voices,
    Flames of Hell and Screams of Woe!
Grace Divine how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace which I have found.

But at length a Word of Healing
    Sweeter than an Angel's Note,
From the Saviour's Lips distilling
    Chas'd Despair and chang'd my Lot.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the grace which makes me thine.

'Twas a Word well timed and suited
    To the Need of such an Hour,
Sweet to One like me polluted,
    Spoke in Love and seal'd with Pow'r.
Grace Divine how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace which I have found.

I, he said, have seen thee grieving,
    Lov'd thee as I pass'd thee by,
Be not faithless but Believing,
    Look, and Live, and never Die.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the ~race which makes me thine.

Take the Bloody Seal I give thee,
    Deep impress'd upon thy Soul,
God, thy God, will now receive thee,
    Faith hath sav'd thee, thou art Whole.
Grace Divine, how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace which I have found.

All at once my Chains were broken,
    From my Feet my Fetters fell,
And that Word in Pity spoken,
    Snatch'd me from the gates of Hell.
Grace Divine, how sweet the Sound,
Sweet the grace which I have found.

Since that Hour in Hope of Glory,
    With thy Foll'wers I am found,
And relate the wondrous Story
    To thy list'ning Saints around.
Sweet the Sound of Grace Divine,
Sweet the grace which makes me thine.

   <title>Sea Song</title>
   <firstline>A wet sheet and a flowing sea</firstline>
</head>
<body>
A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
A wind that follows fast, 
And fills the white and rustling sail,
And bends the gallant mast— 
And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While, like the eagle free, 
Away the good ship flies, and leaves
Old England on the lee.

"O for a soft and gentle mind!"
I heard a fair one cry; 
But give to me the snoring breeze
And white waves heaving high— 
And white waves heaving high, my boys,
The good ship tight and free; 
The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.

There's tempest in yon hornèd moon,
And lightning in yon cloud; 
And hark the music, mariners!
The wind is piping loud— 
The wind is piping loud, my boys,
The lightning flashing free; 
While the hollow oak our palace is,
Our heritage the sea.

    <title>Know Ye the Fair One Whom I Love</title>
    <firstline>Know ye the fair one whom I love</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<sc>Know</sc> ye the fair one whom I love?
  High is her white and holy hrow; 
Her looks so saintly-sweet and pure, 
  Make men adore who come to wooe. 
Her neck, o'er which her tresses hing, 
Is snow beneath a raven's wing. 

Her lips are like the red-rose bud, 
  Dew-parted in a morn of June; 
Her voice is gentler than the sound 
  Of some far-heard and heavenly tune. 
Her little finger, white and round,
Can make a hundred hearts to bound.

My love's two eyes are bonnie stars, 
  Born to adorn the summer skies; 
And I will by our tryste-thorn sit, 
  To watch them at their evening rise; 
That when they shine on tower and tree,
Their heavenly light may fall on me.    

Come, starry eve, demure and gray, 
  Now is the hour when maidens wooe, 
Come shake o'er wood, and bank, and brae, 
  Thy tresses moist with balmy dew: 
Thy dew ne'er dropt on flower or tree,
So lovely or so sweet as she.

The laverock's bosom shone with dew,
  Beside us on the lilied lea, 
She sung her mate down from the cloud 
  To warble by my love and me; 
Nor from her young ones sought to move, 
For well she saw our looks were love.

    <title>The Sailors Lady</title>
    <firstline>Come busk you gallantlie</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Come busk you gallantlie,
  Busk and make you ready, 
Maiden, busk and come,
  And be a sailor's lady. 
The foamy ocean's ours,
  From Hebride to Havannah, 
And thou shalt be my queen,
  And reign upon it, Anna.

See my bonnie ship,
  So stately and so steady; 
Thou shalt be my queen,
  And she maun be my lady: 
The west wind in her wings,
  The deep sea all in motion, 
Away she glorious goes,
  And crowns me king of ocean.

The merry, lads are mine,
  From Thames, and Tweed, and Shannon; 
The Bourbon flowers grow pale
  When I hangout my pennon;
I'll win thee gold and gems,
  With pike and cutlass clashing, 
With all my broad sails set, 
  And all my cannon flashing.

Come with me and see
  The golden islands glowing, 
Come with me and hear 
  The flocks of India lowing: 
Thy fire shall be of spice, 
  The dews of eve drop manna, 
Thy chamber floor of gold, 
  And men adore thee, Anna.

    <title>Gentle Hugh Herries</title>
    <firstline>Go seek in the wild glen</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Go seek in the wild glen
  Where streamlets are falling, 
Go seek on the lone hill
Where curlews are calling, 
  Go seek when the clear stars
Shine down without number, 
  For there will ye find him
My true love in slumber.

They sought in the wild glen—
  The glen was forsaken; 
They sought on the mountain,
  'Mang lang lady-bracken; 
And sore, sore they hunted
  My true love to find him, 
With the strong bands of iron
  To fetter and bind him.

Yon green hill I'll give thee, 
  Where the falcon is flying, 
To show me the den where 
  This bold traitor's lying— 
O make me of Nithsdale's 
  Fair princedom the heiress, 
Is that worth one smile of 
  My gentle Hugh Herries? 

The white bread, the sweet milk, 
  And ripe fruits I found him, 
And safe in my fond arms 
  I clasp'd and I wound him; 
I warn you go not where
  My true lover tarries, 
For sharp smites the sword of 
  My gentle Hugh Herries. 

They rein'd their proud war-steeds,
  Away they went sweeping, 
And behind them dames wail'd, and
  Fair maidens went weeping; 
But deep in yon wild glen,
  'Mang banks of blae-berries, 
I dwell with my loved one,
  My gentle Hugh Herries.

<i>Right honorable, although I rather desired to keep in the priuate passions of my youth, from the multitude, as things vtterd to my selfe, and consecrated to silence: yet seeing I was betraide by the indiscretion of a greedie Printer, and had some of my secrets bewraide to the world, vncorrected: doubting the like of the rest, I am forced to publish that which I neuer ment. But this wrong was not onely doone to mee, but to him whose vnmatchable lines haue indured the like misfortune; Ignorance sparing not to commit sacriledge vpon so holy Reliques. Yet</i> Astrophel,<i> flying with the wings of his own fame, a higher pitch then the gross-sighted can discerne, hath registred his owne name in the Annals of eternitie, and cannot be disgraced, howsoeuer disguised. And for my selfe, seeing I am thrust out into the worlde, and that my vnboldned Muse, is forced to appeare so rawly in publique; I desire onely to bee graced by the countenance of your protection: whome the fortune of our time hath made the happie and iudiciall Patronesse of the Muses, (a glory hereditary to your house) to preserue them from those hidious Beastes, Obliuion, and Barbarisme. Whereby you doe not onely possesse the honour of the present, but also do bind posterity to an euer gratefull memorie of your vertues, wherein you must suruiue your selfe. And if my lines heereafter better laboured, shall purchase grace in the world, they must remaine the monuments of your honourable fauour, and recorde the zealous duetie of mee, who am vowed to your honour in all obseruancy for euer,</i>

    Vnto the boundles Ocean of thy beautie
Runs this poore riuer, charg'd with streames of zeale:
Returning thee the tribute of my dutie,
Which heere my loue, my youth, my playnts reueale.
    Heere I vnclaspe the booke of my charg'd soule,
Where I haue cast th'accounts of all my care:
Heere haue I summ'd my sighes, heere I enroule
Howe they were spent for thee; Looke what they are.
    Looke on the deere expences of my youth,
And see how iust I reckon with thyne eyes:
Examine well thy beautie with my trueth,
And crosse my cares ere greater summes arise.
        Reade it sweet maide, though it be doone but slightly;
        Who can shewe all his loue, doth loue but lightly.

    Goe wailing verse, the infants of my loue,

Present the image of the cares I proue,
Witnes your Fathers griefe exceedes all other.
    Sigh out a story of her cruell deedes,
With interrupted accents of dispayre:
A Monument that whosoeuer reedes,
May iustly praise, and blame my loueles Faire.
    Say her disdaine hath dryed vp my blood,
And starued you, in succours still denying:
Presse to her eyes, importune me some good;
Waken her sleeping pittie with your crying.
        Knock at that hard hart, beg till you haue moou'd her;
        And tell th'vnkind, how deerely I haue lou'd her.

Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint aboue.

Liue reconciled friends within her brow:

Then who had heard the plaints I vtter now.

I vowe my faith, where faith is not regarded;
I pray in vaine, a merciles to moue:
So rare a faith ought better be rewarded.

Though my soules Idoll scorneth all my vowes;
Though all my prayers be to so deafe eares:
No fauour though the cruell faire allowes.

    Come death the Anchor-holde of all my thoughtes,
My last Resort whereto my soule appealeth;
For all too long on earth my fancy dotes,
Whilst my best blood my younge desiers sealeth.
    That hart is now the prospectiue of horror,
That honored hath the cruelst faire that lyueth:
The cruelst faire, that sees I languish for her,
Yet neuer mercy to my merit giueth.
    This is her Lawrell and her triumphes prize,
To tread me downe with foote of her disgrace:
Whilst I did builde my fortune in her eyes,
And laide my liues rest on so faire a face;
        That rest I lost, my loue, my life and all,
        So high attempts to lowe disgraces fall.

These teares, which heate of sacred flame distils;
Are these due tributes that my faith dooth pay
Vnto the tyrant; whose vnkindnes kils.
    I sacrifize my youth, and blooming yeares,
At her proud feete, and she respects not it:
My flowre vntimely's withred with my teares,
And winter woes, for spring of youth vnfit.
    She thinkes a looke may recompence my care,
And so with lookes prolongs my long-lookt ease:
As short that blisse, so is the comfort rare,
Yet must that blisse my hungry thoughts appease.
        Thus she returnes my hopes so fruitlesse euer,
        Once let her loue indeede, or eye me neuer.

Yet soone againe I must her backe recall,
As one that dyes without her company.
    Thus often as I chase my hope from mee,
Straight way she hates her vnto <i>Delias</i> eyes:
Fed with some pleasing looke there shall she bee,
And so sent backe and thus my fortune lyes.

    How long shall I in mine affliction morne,
A burthen to my selfe, distress'd in minde:
When shall my interdicted hopes returne,
From out despayre wherein they liue confin'd.
    When shall her troubled browe charg'd with disdaine,
Reueale the treasure which her smyles impart:
When shall my faith the happinesse attaine,
To breake the yce that hath congeald her hart.
    Vnto her selfe, her selfe my loue dooth sommon,
If loue in her hath any powre to moue:
And let her tell me as she is a woman,
Whether my faith hath not deseru'd her loue.
        I knowe she cannot but must needes confesse it,
        Yet deignes not with one simple signe t'expresse it.

    Beautie, sweet loue, is like the morning dewe,
Whose short refresh vpon the tender greene,
Cheeres for a time but tyll the Sunne doth shew,
And straight tis gone as it had neuer beene.
    Soone doth it fade that makes the fairest florish,
Short is the glory of the blushing Rose,
The hew which thou so carefully doost nourish,
Yet which at length thou must be forc'd to lose.
    When thou surcharg'd with burthen of thy yeeres,
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth:
When tyme hath made a pasport for thy feares,
Dated in age the Kalends of our death.
        But ah no more, thys hath beene often tolde,
        And women grieue to thinke they must be old.

    I must not grieue my Loue, whose eyes would reede,
Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smyle:
Flowers haue a tyme before they come to seede,
And she is young and now must sport the while.
    Ah sport sweet Mayde in season of these yeeres,
And learne to gather flowers before they wither:
And where the sweetest blossoms first appeares,
Let loue and youth conduct thy pleasures thither.
    Lighten forth smyles to cleere the clowded ayre,
And calme the tempest which my sighes doe rayse:
Pittie and smyles doe best become the fayre,
Pittie and smyles shall yeeld thee lasting prayse.
        I hope to say when all my griefes are gone,
        Happy the hart that sigh'd for such a one.

My toucht hart turnes it to that happie cost:
My ioyfull North, where all my fortune lyes,
The leuell of my hopes desired most.
    There where my <i>Delia</i> fayrer then the sunne,
Deckt with her youth whereon the world smyleth:
Ioyes in that honour which her beautie wonne,
Th'eternall volume which her fame compyleth.
    Florish faire <i>Albion</i>, glory of the North,
<i>Neptunes</i> darling helde betweene his armes:
Deuided from the world as better worth,
Kept for himselfe, defended from all harmes.
        Still let disarmed peace decke her and thee;
        And Muse-foe <i>Mars</i>, abroade farre fostred bee.

    Care-charmer sleepe, sonne of the Sable night,
Brother to death, in silent darknes borne:
Relieue my languish, and restore the light,
With darke forgetting of my cares returne.
    And let the day be time enough to morne,
The shipwrack of my ill-aduentred youth:
Let waking eyes suffice to wayle theyr scorne,
Without the torment of the nights vntruth.
    Cease dreames, th'ymagery of our day desires,
To modell foorth the passions of the morrow:
Neuer let rysing Sunne approue you lyers,
To adde more griefe to aggrauat my sorrow.
        Still let me sleepe, imbracing clowdes in vaine;
        And neuer wake, to feele the dayes disdayne.

In aged accents, and vntimely words:
Paint shadowes in imaginary lines,
Which well the reach of their high wits records;
    But I must sing of thee and those faire eyes,
Autentique shall my verse in time to come,
When yet th'vnborne shall say, loe where she lyes,
Whose beautie made him speake that els was dombe.
    These are the Arkes the Tropheis I erect,
That fortifie thy name against old age,
And these thy sacred vertues must protect,
Against the Darke and times consuming rage.
        Though th'error of my youth they shall discouer,
        Suffice they shew I liu'd and was thy louer.

    Like as the Lute that ioyes or els dislikes,
As is his arte that playes vpon the same:
So sounds my Muse according as she strikes,
On my hart strings high tun'd vnto her fame.
    Her touch doth cause the warble of the sound,
Which heere I yeeld in lamentable wise,
A wailing deskant on the sweetest ground,
Whose due reports giue honor to her eyes.
    Els harsh my style, vntunable my Muse,
Hoarce sounds the voyce that prayseth not her name:
If any pleasing realish heere I vse,
Then iudge the world her beautie giues the same.
        O happie ground that makes the musique such,
        And blessed hand that giues so sweete a tuch.

    None other fame myne vnambitious Muse,
Affected euer but t'eternize thee:
All other honours doe my hopes refuse,
Which meaner priz'd and momentarie bee.
    For God forbid I should my papers blot,
With mercynary lines, with seruile pen:
Praising vertues in them that haue them not,
Basely attending on the hopes of men.
    No no my verse respects nor Thames nor Theaters,
Nor seekes it to be knowne vnto the Great:
But <i>Auon</i> rich in fame, though poore in waters,
Shall haue my song, where <i>Delia</i> hath her seate.
        <i>Auon</i> shall be my Thames, and she my Song;
        Ile sound her name the Ryuer all along.

Inkindled by her eyes celestiall fiers.
    Celestiall fiers and vnrespecting powers,
That deigne not view the glory of your might,
In humble lines the worke of carefull howers,
The sacrifice I offer to her sight.
    But sith she scornes her owne, this rests for me,
Ile mone my selfe, and hide the wrong I haue:
And so content me that her frownes should be
To my' infant stile the cradle, and the graue.
        What though my selfe no honor get thereby,
        Each byrd sings t'herselfe, and so will I.

    Loe heere the impost of a faith vnfaining,
That loue hath paide, and her disdaine extorted:
Beholde the message of my iust complayning,
That shewes the world how much my griefe imported.
    These tributary plaintes fraught with desire,
I sende those eyes the cabinets of loue;
The Paradice whereto my hopes aspire,
From out this hell, which mine afflictions proue.
    Wherein I thus doe liue cast downe from myrth,
Pensiue alone, none but despayre about mee;
My ioyes abortiue, perisht at their byrth,
My cares long liu'de, and will not dye without mee.
        This is my state, and <i>Delias</i> hart is such;
        I say no more, I feare I saide too much.

Nowe each creature ioyes the other,
    Passing happy daies and howers:
One byrd reports vnto another,
    In the fall of siluer showers,
Whilst the earth our common mother,
    Hath her bosome deckt with flowers.

Whilst the greatest torch of heauen,
    With bright rayes warmes <i>Floras</i> lappe:
Making nights and dayes both euen,
    Cheering plants with fresher sappe:
My field of flowers quite be-reauen,
    Wants refresh of better happe.

Eccho daughter of the ayre,
    Babbling gheste of Rocks and Hills,
Knowes the name of my fearce Fayre,
    And soundes the accents of my ills:
Each thing pitties my dispaire,
    Whilst that she her Louer kills.

Whilst that she O cruell Maide,
    Doth me, and my true loue dispise:
My liues florish is decayde
    That depended on her eyes:
But her will must be obaide,
    And well he'ends for loue who dies.

T:To the Reader of these Sonnets
F:Into these Loues, who but for Passion lookes
K:sonnet

<i>Into these Loues, who but for Passion lookes,
At this first sight, here let him lay them by,
And seeke else-where, in turning other Bookes,
Which better may his labour satisfie.
No farre-fetch'd Sigh shall euer wound my Brest,
Loue from mine Eye a Teare shall neuer wring,
Nor in </i>Ah-mees<i> my whyning Sonnets drest,
(A Libertine) fantastickly I sing:
My Verse is the true image of my Mind,
Euer in motion, still desiring change;
And as thus to Varietie inclin'd,
So in all Humors sportiuely I range:
    My Muse is rightly of the </i>English<i> straine,
    That cannot long one fashion intertaine.</i>

K:sonnet

Like an aduenturous Sea-farer am I,
Who hath some long and dang'rous Voyage beene,
And call'd to tell of his Discouerie,
How farre he sayl'd, what Countries he had seene,
Proceeding from the Port whence he put forth,
Shewes by his Compasse, how his Course he steer'd,
When East, when West, when South, and when by North,
As how the Pole to eu'ry place was rear'd,
What Capes he doubled, of what Continent,
The Gulphes and Straits, that strangely he had past,
Where most becalm'd, wherewith foule Weather spent,
And on what Rocks in perill to be cast?
    Thus in my Loue, Time calls me to relate
    My tedious Trauels, and oft-varying Fate.

My Heart was slaine, and none but you and I:
Who should I thinke the Murther should commit?
Since, but your selfe, there was no Creature by,
But onely I, guiltlesse of murth'ring it.
It slew it selfe; the Verdict on the view
Doe quit the dead, and me not accessarie:
Well, well, I feare it will be prou'd by you,
Th'euidence so great a proofe doth carrie.
But O, see, see, we need inquire no further,
Vpon your Lips the scarlet drops are found,
And in your Eye, the Boy that did the Murther,
Your Cheekes yet pale, since first he gaue the Wound.
    By this I see, how-euer things be past,
    Yet Heau'n will still haue Murther out at last.

Taking my Penne, with Words to cast my Woe,
Duely to count the summe of all my cares,
I finde, my Griefes innumerable growe,
The reck'nings rise to millions of Despaires,
And thus diuiding of my fatall Houres,
The paiments of my Loue, I read, and crosse,
Substracting, set my Sweets vnto my Sowres,
My Ioyes arrerage leades me to my losse;
And thus mine Eies a debtor to thine Eye,
Which by Extortion gaineth all their lookes,
My heart hath paid such grieuous Vsurie,
That all their Wealth lies in thy beauties Bookes,
    And all is Thine which hath been due to Me,
    And I a Bankrupt, quite vndone by Thee.

Bright starre of Beauty, on whose eye-lids sit
A thousand Nimph-like and inamor'd Graces,
The Goddesses of Memory and Wit,
Which there in order take their seuerall places,
In whose deare Bosome, sweet delicious Loue
Layes downe his Quiuer, which he once did beare:
Since he that blessed Paradise did proue,
And leaues his Mothers lap to sport him there,
Let others striue to entertaine with Words,
My Soule is of a brauer Mettle made,
I hold that vile, which Vulgar wit affords;
In Me's that Faith which Time cannot inuade.
    Let what I praise, be still made good by you:
    Be you most worthy, whilst I am most true.

And let me take my selfe what I doe craue,

That where those two cleare sparkling Eyes are plac'd,
Onely two Loope-holes, then I might behold.
That louely, arched, yuorie, polish'd Brow,
Defac'd with Wrinkles, that I might but see;
Thy daintie Hayre, so curl'd, and crisped now,
Like grizzled Mosse vpon some aged Tree;
Thy Cheeke, now flush with Roses, sunke, and leane,
Thy Lips, with age, as any Wafer thinne,
Thy Pearly Teeth out of thy Head so cleane,
That when thou feed'st, thy Nose shall touch thy Chinne:
    These Lines that now scorn'st, which should delight thee,
    Then would I make thee read, but to despight thee.

Leauing the Path the greater part doe goe;
I will resolue you; I am Lunaticke,
And euer this in Mad-men you shall finde,
What they last thought of, when the Braine grew sicke,
In most distraction they keepe that in Minde.
Thus talking idly in this Bedlam fit,
Reason and I (you must conceiue) are twaine,
Tis nine yeeres now since first I lost my Wit,
Beare with Me then, though troubled be my Braine;
    With Diet and Correction, Men distraught,

Leaues to his Sonne all he had heap'd together;
This new rich Nouice, lauish of his chest,
To one Man giues, doth on another spend,
Then heere he riots, yet among the rest,
Haps to lend some to one true honest Friend.
Thy Gifts thou in Obscuritie doest waste,
False Friends thy kindnesse, borne but to deceiue Thee;
Thy Loue, that is on the vnworthy plac'd,
Time hath thy Beautie, which with Age will leaue thee;
    Onely that little which to Me was lent,
    I giue Thee backe, when all the rest is spent.

Transported from my Selfe, into Your being,
Though either distant, present yet to either,
Senselesse with too much Ioy, each other seeing,
And onely absent, when Wee are together.
Giue Me my Selfe, and take your Selfe againe,
Deuise some meanes, but how I may forsake You,
So much is Mine, that doth with You remaine,
That taking what is Mine, with Me I take You;

    From my Selfe You, or from your owne Selfe I.

Paper and Inke can paint but naked Words,
To write with Bloud, of force offends the Sight;
And if with Teares I find them all too light,
And Sighes and Signes a silly Hope affords,
O sweetest Shadow, how thou seru'st my turne!
Which still shalt be, as long as there is Sunne;
Nor whilst the World is, neuer shall be done,
Whilst Moone shall shine, or any Fire shall burne:

And thy Youth past, in this pure Mirrour see,
As the World's Beautie in his Infancie,
What it was then, and thou before it was;
Passe on, and to Posteritie tell this,
Yet see thou tell, but truly, what hath beene:
Say to our Nephewes, that thou once hast seene,
In perfect humane shape, all heau'nly Blisse;
    And bid them mourne, nay more, despaire with thee,
    That she is gone, her like againe to see.

Before my Face, it layes downe my Despaires,
And hastes Me on vnto a sudden Death;
Now tempting Me, to drowne my Selfe in teares,
And then in sighing, to giue vp my breath;

Note by my Sighes, and thine Eyes shall behold
The Sun-beames smothered with immortall Smoke,
And if by Thee my Prayers may be enrol'd
They Heauen and Earth to pitty shall prouoke;
Looke Thou into my brest, and Thou shalt see
Chaste holy Vowes for my Soules sacrifice,
That Soule (sweet Maid) which so hath honor'd Thee,
Erecting Trophies to thy Sacred Eyes,
    Those Eyes to my Heart shining euer bright
    When Darknesse hath obscur'd each other Light.

When like an Eaglet I first found my Loue,
For that the vertue I thereof would know,
Vpon the Nest I set it forth, to proue
If it were of that Kingly kind, or no:
But it no sooner saw my Sunne appeare,
But on her Rayes with open Eyes it stood,
To shew, that I had hatch'd it for the Ayre,
And rightly came from that braue mounting Brood;
And when the Plumes were summ'd with sweet desire,
To proue the Pynions, it ascends the Skyes;
Doe what I could, it needsly would aspire
To my Soules Sunne, those two Celestiall Eyes:
    Thus from my Brest, where it was bred alone,
    It after thee, is like an Eaglet flowne.

You best discern'd of my Minds inward Eyes,

Whose deare remembrance in my Bosome lyes,
Too rich a Relique for so poore a Shrine:
You, in whom Nature chose her selfe to view,
When she her owne perfection would admire,
Bestowing all her Excellence on you;
At whose pure Eyes, Loue lights his hallow'd Fire,
Eu'n as a Man that in some Trance hath seene
More then his wond'ring vtt'rance can vnfold,
That rapt in Spirit, in better Worlds hath beene,
So must your prayse distractedly be told;
    Most of all short, when I should shew you most,
    In your perfections so much am I lost.

In former times, such as had store of Coyne,
In Warres at home, or when for Conquests bound,
For feare that some their Treasure should purloyne,
Gaue it to keepe to Spirits within the Ground;
And to attend it, them as strongly ty'd
Till they return'd; Home when they neuer came,
Such as by Art to get the same haue try'd,
From the strong Spirit by no meanes force the same;
Neerer Men come, That further flyes away,
Striuing to hold it strongly in the Deepe:
Eu'n as this Spirit, so you alone doe play
With those rich Beauties Heau'n giues you to keepe:
    Pittie so left, to th'coldnesse of your Blood,
    Not to auaile you, nor doe others good.

Fortune assists the boldest, I reply,
A hastie Man (quoth he) ne'r wanted Woe;
Labour is light, where Loue (quoth I) doth pay,
(Saith he) Light Burthen's heauy, if farre borne;
(Quoth I) The Maine lost, cast the By away;
You haue spunne a faire Thred, he replyes in scorne.</i>
    And hauing thus awhile each other thwarted,
    Fooles as we met, so Fooles againe we parted.

Behold the Clouds which haue eclips'd my Sunne,
And view the Crosses which my course doe let,
Tell Me, if euer since the World begunne,
So Faire a rising, had so Foule a set:

    Can shew a Second to so pure a Loue.

Be it not seene in either of our Browes,

Now at the last gaspe, of Loues latest Breath,
When his Pulse fayling, Passion speechlesse lies,
When Faith is kneeling by his bed of Death,
And Innocence is closing vp his Eyes,

    From Death to Life, thou might'st him yet recouer.

I build my Hopes a world aboue the Skie,
Yet with the Mole I creepe into the Earth,
In Plenty I am staru'd with Penurie,
And yet I Surfet in the greatest Dearth:
    I haue, I want, Despaire, and yet desire,
    Burn'd in a Sea of yce, and drown'd amidst a fire.

My Heart for Hostage that it shall remaine,
Discharge our Forces, here let Malice cease,
So for my Pledge thou giue me Pledge againe.
Or if no thing but Death will serue thy turne,
Still thirsting for subuersion of my state;
Doe what thou canst, raze, massacre, and burne;
Let the World see the vtmost of thy hate:
    I send defiance, since if ouerthrowne,
    Thou vanquishing, the Conquest is mine owne.

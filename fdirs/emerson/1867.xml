Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days
Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes
And marching single in an endless file, 
Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.
To each they offer gifts after his will, 
Bread, kingdom, stars, and sky that holds them all.
I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,
Forgot my morning wishes, hastily
Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day
Turned and departed silent. I, too late
Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.

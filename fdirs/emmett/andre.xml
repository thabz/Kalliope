I wish I was in de land ob cotton,
Old times dar am not forgotten;
    Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land!
In Dixie Land whar I was born in,
Early on one frosty mornin,
    Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land!

        Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!
        In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand, to lib an' die in Dixie.
      Away! away! away down South in Dixie.
       Away! away! away down south in Dixie.

Ole missus marry "Will-de-weaber";
Willum was a gay deceaber;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!
But when he put his arm around her,
He smiled as fierce as a forty-pounder;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!

          Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!
          In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand, to lib an' die in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down South in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down south in Dixie.

His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaber;
But dat did not seem to greab her;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!
Ole missus acted de foolish part,
And died for a man dat broke her heart;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!

          Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!
          In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand, to lib an' die in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down South in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down south in Dixie.

Now here's health to de next ole missus,
An' all the gals dat want to kiss us;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!
But if you want to drive 'way sorrow,
Come and hear dis song tomorrow;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!

          Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!
          In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand, to lib an' die in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down South in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down south in Dixie.

Dar's buckwheat cakes an' Injin batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!
Den hoe it down an' scratch your grabble,
To Dixie's land I'm bound to trabble;
    Look away, look away, look away, Dixie land!

          Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray! Hooray!
          In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand, to lib an' die in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down South in Dixie.
        Away! away! away down south in Dixie.

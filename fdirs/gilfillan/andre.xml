<sc>Oh!</sc> why left I my hame?	
  Why did I cross the deep?	
Oh! why left I the land	
  Where my forefathers sleep?	
I sigh for Scotia’s shore,	
  And I gaze across the sea,	
But I canna get a blink	
  O’ my ain countrie.	

The palm-tree waveth high,	
  And fair the myrtle springs;
And, to the Indian maid,	
  The bulbul sweetly sings.	
But I dinna see the broom	
  Wi’ its tassels on the lee,	
Nor hear the lintie’s sang	
  O’ my ain countrie.	

Oh! here no Sabbath bell	
  Awakes the Sabbath morn,	
Nor song of reapers heard	
  Amang the yellow corn:	
For the tyrant’s voice is here,	
  And the wail of slaverie;	
But the sun of freedom shines	
  In my ain countrie.	

There’s a hope for every woe,	
  And a balm for every pain,	
But the first joys o’ our heart	
  Come never back again.	
There’s a track upon the deep,	
  And a path across the sea;
But the weary ne’er return	
  To their ain countrie.

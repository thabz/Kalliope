   <title>Where is the Sea?</title>
   <subtitle>Song of the Greek islander in Exile</subtitle>
   <firstline>Where is is the sea? - I languish here -</firstline>

<body>
<nonum><wrap>A Greek Islander, being taken to the Vale of Tempe, and called upon to admire its beauty, only replied—“<i>The sea—where is it?</i>”</wrap></nonum>
    
Where is is the sea?—I languish here—
  Where is my own blue sea?
With all its barks in fleet career,
  And flags, and breezes free.
 
I miss that voice of waves, which first 
  Awoke my childhood's glee;
The measured chime—the thundering burst—
  Where is my own blue sea?

Oh! rich your myrtle's breath may rise,
  Soft, soft your winds may be;
Yet my sick heart within me dies— 
  Where is my own blue sea?
  
I hear the shepherd's mountain flute— 
  I hear the whispering tree;—
The echoes of my soul are mute:
  —Where is my own blue sea?

I dream of all things free!
  Of a gallant, gallant bark,
That sweeps through storm and sea
  Like an arrow to its mark!
Of a stag that o'er the hills
  Goes bounding in his glee;
Of a thousand flashing rills—
  Of all things glad and free.

I dream of some proud bird,
  A bright-eyed mountain king! 
In my visions I have heard
  The rushing of his wing.
I follow some wild river,
  On whose breast no sail may be;
Dark woods around it shiver -
  I dream of all things free!

Of a happy forest child,
  With the fawns and flowers at play;
Of an Indian midst the wild,
  With the stars to guide his way:
Of a chief his warriora leading,
  Of an archer's green wood tree; -
My heart in chains is bleeding; -
  And I dream of all things free.

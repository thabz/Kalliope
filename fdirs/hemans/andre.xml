   <title>Where is the Sea?</title>
   <subtitle>Song of the Greek islander in Exile</subtitle>

<poetry>
<nonum><wrap>A Greek Islander, being taken to the Vale of Tempe, and called upon to admire its beauty, only replied—“<i>The sea—where is it?</i>”</wrap></nonum>

Where is is the sea?—I languish here—
  Where is my own blue sea?
With all its barks in fleet career,
  And flags, and breezes free.

I miss that voice of waves, which first
  Awoke my childhood's glee;
The measured chime—the thundering burst—
  Where is my own blue sea?

Oh! rich your myrtle's breath may rise,
  Soft, soft your winds may be;
Yet my sick heart within me dies—
  Where is my own blue sea?

I hear the shepherd's mountain flute—
  I hear the whispering tree;—
The echoes of my soul are mute:
  —Where is my own blue sea?

<poetry>
I DREAM of all things free!
  Of a gallant, gallant bark,
That sweeps through storm and sea
  Like an arrow to its mark!
Of a stag that o'er the hills
  Goes bounding in his glee;
Of a thousand flashing rills—
  Of all things glad and free.

I dream of some proud bird,
  A bright-eyed mountain king!
In my visions I have heard
  The rushing of his wing.
I follow some wild river,
  On whose breast no sail may be;
Dark woods around it shiver -
  - I dream of all things free!

Of a happy forest child,
  With the fawns and flowers at play;
Of an Indian midst the wild,
  With the stars to guide his way:
Of a chief his warriors leading,
  Of an archer's greenwood tree:-
- My heart in chains is bleeding,
  And I dream of all things free.

    <title>The Child's First Grief</title>
    <firstline>Oh! call my brother back to me!</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
<sc>Oh</sc>! call my brother back to me!
  I cannot play alone;
The summer comes with flower and bee—
  Where is my brother gone?

“The butterfly is glancing bright
  Across the sunbeam's track;
I care not now to chase its flight—
  Oh! call my brother back!

“The flowers run wild the—flowers we sow'd
  Around our garden tree;
Our vine is drooping with its load—
  Oh! call him back to me!”

“He would not hear thy voice, fair child!
  He may not come to thee;
The face that once like spring-time smiled,
  On earth no more thou'lt see.

“A rose's brief, bright life of joy,
  Such unto him was given:
Go thou must play alone, my boy!
  Thy brother is in heaven.”

“And has he left his birds and flowers;
  And must I call in vain?
And through the long, long summer hours,
  Will he not come again?

“And by the brook and in the glade
  Are all our wanderings o'er?
Oh! while my brother with me play'd,
  <i>Would I had loved him more!</i>”

<body>
I lie in a heavy trance,	
With a world of dream without me	
Shapes of shadow dance,	
In wavering bands about me;	
But, at times, some mystic things	
Appear in this phantom lair,	
That almost seem to me visitings	
Of Truth known elsewhere:	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A prayer in an hour of pain,	
Begun in an undertone,	
Then lowered, as it would fain	
Be heard by the heart alone;	
A throb, when the soul is entered	
By a light that is lit above,	
Where the God of Nature has centered	
The Beauty of Love.—	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A look that is telling a tale,	
Which looks alone dare tell,—	
When a cheek is no longer pale,	
That has caught the glance, as it fell;	
A touch, which seems to unlock	
Treasures unknown as yet,	
And the bitter-sweet first shock,	
One can never forget;	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A sense of an earnest Will	
To help the lowly-living,—	
And a terrible heart-thrill,	
If you have no power of giving:	
An arm of aid to the weak,
A friendly hand to the friendless,	
Kind words, so short to speak,	
But whose echo is endless:	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

The moment we think we have learnt	
The lore of the all-wise One,	
By which we could stand unburnt,	
On the ridge of the seething sun:	
The moment we grasp at the clue,
Long-lost and strangely riven,	
Which guides our soul to the True,	
And the Poet to Heaven.	
The world is wide,—these things are small,—	
If they be nothing, what is there at all?

Let me this gondola boat compare to the slumberous cradle,
And to a spacious bier liken the cover demure;
Thus on the Great Canal through life we are swaying and swimming
Onward with never a care, coffin and cradle between.

Strangers yet!
After years of life together,
After fair and stormy weather,
After travel in far lands,
After touch of wedded hands, —
Why thus joined? Why ever met.
If they must be strangers yet?

Strangers yet!
After childhood's winning ways.
After care and blame and praise.
Counsel asked and wisdom given.
After mutual prayers to Heaven,
Child and parent scarce regret
When they part — are strangers yet

Strangers yet!
After strife for common ends —
After title of ''old friends,''
After passions fierce and tender,
After cheerful self-surrender.
Hearts may beat and eyes be met.
And the souls be strangers yet.

Strangers yet!
Oh! the bitter thought to scan
All the loneliness of man:—
Nature, by magnetic laws,
Circle unto circle draws,
But they only touch when met,
Never mingle — strangers yet

Strangers yet!
Will it evermore be thus —
Spirits still impervious?
Shall we never fairly stand
Soul to soul as hand to hand?
Are the bounds eternal set
To retain us — strangers yet?

Strangers yet!
Tell not Love it must aspire
Unto something other — higher:
God himself were loved the best
Were our sympathies at rest,
Rest above the strain and fret
Of the world of — strangers yet!

I wandered by the brook-side, 
I wandered by the mill, - 
I could not hear the brook flow. 
The noisy wheel was still; 
There was no burr of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird. 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I heard. 

I sat beneath the elm-tree, 
I watched the long, long, shade. 
And as it grew still longer, 
I did not feel afraid; 
For I listened for a footfall, 
I listened for a word, - 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I heard. 

He came not, - no, be came not, - 
The night came on alone, - 
The little stars sat one by one. 
Each on his golden throne;     
The evening air passed by my cheek. 
The leaves above were stirred, - 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I heard. 

Fast silent tears were flowing, 
When something stood behind, - 
A hand was on my shoulder, 
I knew its touch was kind: 
It drew me nearer - nearer, - 
We did not speak one word, 
For the becUing of our own hearts 
Was all the sound we heard.

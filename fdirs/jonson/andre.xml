<poetry>
<sc>Oh</sc> doe not wanton with those eyes,
    Lest I be sick with seeing;
Nor cast them downe, but let them rise,
    Lest shame destroy their being:
O, be not angry with those fires,
    For then their threats will kill me;
Nor looke too kind on my desires,
    For then my hopes will spill me;
O, doe not steepe them in thy Teares,
    For so will sorrow slay me;
Nor spread them as distract with feares,
    Mine owne enough betray me.

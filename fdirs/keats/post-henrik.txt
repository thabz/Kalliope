I.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
  Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has wither'd from the lake,
  And no birds sing.

II.

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms!
  So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
  And the harvest's done.

III.

I see a lily on thy brow
  With anguish moist and fever dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
  Fast withereth too.

IV.

I met a lady in the meads,
  Full beautiful-a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
  And her eyes were wild.

V.

I made a garland for her head,
  And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She look'd at me as she did love,
  And made sweet moan.

VI.

I set her on my pacing steed,
  And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
  A faery's song.

VII.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
  And honey wild, and manna dew,
And sure in language strange she said-
  "I love thee true."

VIII.

She took me to her elfin grot,
  And there she wept, and sigh'd fill sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
  With kisses four.

IX.

And there she lulled me asleep,
  And there I dream'd-Ah! woe betide!
The latest dream I ever dream'd
  On the cold hill's side.

X.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
  Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried-"La Belle Dame sans Merci
  Hath thee in thrall!"

XI.

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
  With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
  On the cold hill's side.

XII.

And this is why I sojourn here,
  Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,
  And no birds sing.

T:Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art
F:Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art
K:sonnet

Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art-
  Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
  Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
  Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
  Of snow upon the mountains and the moors-
No-yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
  Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
  Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever-or else swoon to death.

T:When I have fears that I may cease to be
F:When I have fears that I may cease to be
K:sonnet

When I have fears that I may cease to be   
  Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,   
Before high piled books, in charact’ry,   
  Hold like rich garners the full-ripen’d grain;   
When I behold, upon the night’s starr’d face,           
  Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,   
And think that I may never live to trace   
  Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;   
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!   
  That I shall never look upon thee more,    
Never have relish in the faery power   
  Of unreflecting love!—then on the shore   
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think   
Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.

T:In a drear-nighted December
F:In a drear-nighted December

In a drear-nighted December,   
Too happy, happy tree,   
Thy branches ne’er remember   
Their green felicity:   
The north cannot undo them,           
With a sleety whistle through them;   
Nor frozen thawings glue them   
From budding at the prime.   
   
In a drear-nighted December,   
Too happy, happy brook,    
Thy bubblings ne’er remember   
Apollo’s summer look;   
But with a sweet forgetting,   
They stay their crystal fretting,   
Never, never petting    
About the frozen time.   
   
Ah! would ’t were so with many   
A gentle girl and boy!   
But were there ever any   
Writhed not at passed joy?    
To know the change and feel it,   
When there is none to heal it,   
Nor numbed sense to steal it,   
Was never said in rhyme.

T:Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!
F:Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!

Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!
And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee,
And let me call Heaven’s blessing on thine eyes,
And let me breathe into the happy air,
That doth enfold and touch thee all about,
Vows of my slavery, my giving up,
My sudden adoration, my great love!

T:The Human Seasons
F:Four Seasons fill the measure of the year
K:sonnet

Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;   
  There are four seasons in the mind of man:   
He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear   
  Takes in all beauty with an easy span:   
He has his Summer, when luxuriously
  Spring’s honey’d cud of youthful thought he loves   
To ruminate, and by such dreaming high   
  Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves   
His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings   
  He furleth close; contented so to look
On mists in idleness—to let fair things   
  Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.   
He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,   
Or else he would forego his mortal nature.

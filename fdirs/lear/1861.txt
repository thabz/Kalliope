VN:Bidrag fra Brian Bentsen. Teksten følger <i>The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear</i>, red. Holbrook Jackson, Faber & Faber 2001. <i>A book of Nonsense</i> fra 1846 udkom i nye reviderede og forøgede udgaver i 1855 og 1861. Kalliope bringer alle 112 limericker fra den endelige udgave samt limericken fra titelbladet som Holbrook har overset. Lears nonsensvers ses ofte femlinjede, måske fordi man gerne vil gøre dem til ægte limericks der pr. definition er på fem linjer.

And are ye sure the news is true?
And are ye sure he's weel?
Is this a time to think o' wark?
Mak haste, lay by your wheel;
Is this the time to spin a thread
When Colin's at the door?
Reach me my cloak, I'll to the quay
And see him come ashore.
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

And gie to me my bigonet,
My bishop's satin gown;
For I maun tell the bailie's wife
That Colin's come to town.
My Turkey slippers maun gae on,
My stockings pearly blue;
It's a' to pleasure my gudeman,
For he's baith leel and true.
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

Rise, lass, and mak a clean fire side,
Put on the muckle pot,
Gie little Kate her button gown,
And Jock his Sunday coat;
And mak their shoon as black as slaes,
Their hose as white as snaw,
It's a' to please my ain gudeman,
For he's been lang awa.
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

There's twa fat hens upo' the bauk,
Been fed this month and mair,
Mak haste and thraw their necks about,
That Colin weel may fare;
And mak the table neat and clean,
Gar ilka thing look braw,
For wha can tell how Colin fared
When he was far awa?
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

Sae true his heart, sae smooth his speech,
His breath like cauler air,
His very foot has music in't
As he comes up the stair!
And will I see his face again,
And will I hear him speak?
I'm downright dizzy wi' the thought,
In troth I'm like to greet.
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

If Colin's weel, and weel content,
I hae nae mair to crave--
And gin I live to keep him sae,
I'm blest aboon the lave.
And will I see his face again,
And will I hear him speak?
I'm downright dizzy wi' the thought,
In troth I'm like to greet.
    <i>For there's nae luck about the house,</i>
    <i>There's nae luck at a',</i>
    <i>There's little pleasure in the house</i>
    <i>When our gudeman's awa.</i>

ONCE, in the flight of ages past,
  There lived a man:—and Who was He?
Mortal! howe’er thy lot be cast,
  That Man resembled Thee.

Unknown the region of his birth,
  The land in which he died unknown:
His name has perish’d from the earth;
  This truth survives alone;—

That joy and grief, and hope and fear,
  Alternate triumph’d in his breast;
His bliss and woe,—a smile, a tear!—
  Oblivion hides the rest.

The bounding pulse, the languid limb,
  The changing spirits’ rise and fall;
We know that these were felt by him,
  For these are felt by all.

He suffer’d,—but his pangs are o’er;
  Enjoy’d,—but his delights are fled;
Had friends—his friends are now no more;
  And foes,—his foes are dead.

He loved,—but whom he loved the grave
  Hath lost in its unconscious womb;
O, she was fair!—but nought could save
  Her beauty from the tomb.

He saw whatever thou hast seen;
  Encounter’d all that troubles thee:
He was—whatever thou hast been;
  He is—what thou shalt be.

The rolling seasons, day and night,
  Sun, moon, and stars, the earth and main,
Erewhile his portion, life and light,
  To him exist in vain.

The clouds and sunbeams, o’er his eye
  That once their shades and glory threw,
Have left in yonder silent sky
  No vestige where they flew.

The annals of the human race,
  Their ruins, since the world began,
Of Him afford no other trace
  Than this,—There lived a Man!

“<sc>For</sc> ever with the Lord!”
—Amen; so let it be;
Life from the dead is in that word,
’Tis immortality.

Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam;
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.

My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near,
At times, to faith’s foreseeing eye,
Thy golden gates appear!

Ah! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.

Yet clouds will intervene,
And all my prospect flies;
Like Noah’s dove, I flit between
Rough seas and stormy skies.

Anon the clouds dispart,
The winds and waters cease,
While sweetly o’er my gladden’d heart
Expands the bow of peace.

Beneath its glowing arch,
Along the hallow’d ground,
I see cherubic armies march,
A camp of fire around.

I hear at morn and even,
At noon and midnight hour,
The choral harmonies of heaven
Earth’s Babel-tongues o’erpower.

Then, then I feel that He,
(Remember’d or forgot,)
The Lord, is never far from me,
Though I perceive Him not.

<nonum><center><sc>Part II</sc></center></nonum>

<sc>In</sc> darkness as in light
Hidden alike from view,
I sleep, I wake within His sight
Who looks all nature through.

From the dim hour of birth,
Through every changing state
Of mortal pilgrimage on earth,
Till its appointed date;

All that I am, have been,
All that I yet may be,
He sees at once, as He hath seen
And shall for ever see.

How can I meet His eyes?
Mine on the cross I cast,
And own my life a Saviour’s prize,
Mercy from first to last.

“For ever with the Lord!”
—Father, if ’tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word,
Even here to me fulfil.

Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand,
Fight, and I must prevail.

So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.

Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,
And oft repeat before the throne,
“For ever with the Lord!”

Then, though the soul enjoy
Communion high and sweet,
While worms this body must destroy,
Both shall in glory meet.

The trump of final doom
Will speak the self-same word,
And Heaven’s voice thunder through the tomb,
“For ever with the Lord!”

The tomb shall echo deep
That death-awakening sound;
The saints shall hear it in their sleep
And answer from the ground.

Then, upward as they fly,
That resurrection-word
Shall be their shout of victory,
“For ever with the Lord!”

The resurrection-word,
That shout of victory,
Once more,—“For ever with the Lord!”
Amen; so let it be.

<poetry>
<sc>Hail</sc> to the Lord’s Anointed,
  Great David’s greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
  His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
  To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
  And rule in equity.

He shall come down like showers
  Upon the fruitful earth;
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
  Spring in His path to birth:
Before Him on the mountains
  Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
  From hill to valley flow.

Kings shall fall down before Him,
  And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
  His praise all people sing;
For He shall have dominion
  O’er river, sea, and shore,
Far as the eagle’s pinion,
  Or dove’s light wing can soar.

To Him shall prayer unceasing
  And daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing,
  A kingdom without end.
The mountain dews shall nourish
  A seed in weakness sown,
Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,
  And shake like Lebanon.

O’er every foe victorious
  He on His throne shall rest,
From age to age more glorious,
  All-blessing and all-blest.
The tide of time shall never
  His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever,
  His changeless Name of Love.

<poetry>
Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire,
  Uttered, or unexpressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
  That trembles in the breast.

Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
  The falling of a tear;
The upward glancing of an eye
  When none but God is near.

Prayer is the simplest form of speech
  That infant lips can try;
Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
  The Majesty on high.

Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath,
  The Christian’s native air;
His watchword at the gates of death;
  He enters rest with prayer.

The saints in prayer appear as one,
  In word, and deed, and mind;
While with the Father and the Son
  Sweet fellowship they find.

O Thou, by whom we come to God,
  The Life, the Truth, the Way,
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod—
  Lord, teach us how to pray.

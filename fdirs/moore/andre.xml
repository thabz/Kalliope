<body>
Oft, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Fond Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me:
      The smiles, the tears
      Of boyhood's years,
   The words of love then spoken;
      The eyes that shone,
      Now dimm'd and gone,
   The cheerful hearts now broken!
Thus, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Sad Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me.

When I remember all
   The friends, so link'd together,
I've seen around me fall
   Like leaves in wintry weather,
      I feel like one
      Who treads alone
   Some banquet-hall deserted,
      Whose lights are fled,
      Whose garlands dead,
   And all but he departed!
Thus, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me.
Sad Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me.

   <firstline>Sweet lady, look not thus again</firstline>

<body>
Sweet lady, look not thus again:
Those bright, deluding smiles recall
A maid remember'd now with pain,
Who was my love, my life, my all!

Oh! while this heart bewildered took
Sweet poison from her thrilling eye,
Thus would she smile and lisp and look,
And I would hear and gaze and sigh!

Yes, I did love her - wildly love -
She was her sex's best deceiver!
And oft she swore she'd never rove -
And I was destined to believe her!

Then, lady, do not wear the smile
Of one whose smile could thus betray;
Alas! I think the lovely wile
Again could steal my heart away.

For, when those spells that charmed my mind
On lips so pure as thine I see,
I fear the heart which she resigned
Will err again and fly to thee!

If all the daughters of the sun
Have loving looks and eyes of flame.
Go, tell me not that she is one —
'Twas from the wintry moon she came

And yet, sweet eye! thou ne'er wert given
To kindle what thou dost not feel;
And yet, thou flushing lip — by heaven!
Thou ne'er wert made for Dian's seal!

Oh! for a sunbeam, rich and warm
From thy own Ganges' fervid haunts.
To light thee up, thou lovely fonn!
To all my soul adores and wants:

To see thee burn — to faint and sigh
Upon that bosom as it blaz'd.
And be myself the first to die.
Amid the flame myself had rais'd!

   <title>To Cara, After An Interval Of Absence</title>
   <firstline>Concealed within the shady wood</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
Concealed within the shady wood
    A mother left her sleeping child,
And flew, to cull her rustic food,
    The fruitage of the forest wild.

But storms upon her pathway rise,
    The mother roams, astray and weeping;
Far from the weak appealing cries
    Of him she left so sweetly sleeping.

She hopes, she fears; a light is seen,
    And gentler blows the night wind's breath;
Yet no - 'tis gone - the storms are keen,
    The infant may be chilled to death!

Perhaps, even now, in darkness shrouded,
    His little eyes lie cold and still; -
And yet, perhaps, they are not clouded,
    Life and love may light them still.

Thus, Cara, at our last farewell,
    When, fearful even thy hand to touch,
I mutely asked those eyes to tell
    If parting pained thee half so much:

I thought, - and, oh! forgive the thought,
    For none was e'er by love inspired
Whom fancy had not also taught
    To hope the bliss his soul desired.

Yes, I think, in Cara's mind,
    Though yet to that sweet mind unknown,
I left one infant wish behind,
    One feeling, which I called my own.

Oh blest! though but in fancy blest,
    How did I ask of Pity's care,
To shield and strengthen, in thy breast,
    The nursling I had cradled there.

And, many an hour, beguiled by pleasure,
    And many an hour of sorrow numbering,
I ne'er forgot the new-born treasure,
    I left within thy bosom slumbering.

Perhaps, indifference has not chilled it,
    Haply, it yet a throb may give -
Yet, no - perhaps, a doubt has killed it;
    Say, dearest - the feeling live?

   <title>A Study From The Antique</title>
   <firstline>Behold, my love, the curious gem</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
Behold, my love, the curious gem
    Within this simple ring of gold;
'Tis hallow'd by the touch of them
    Who lived in classic hours of old.

Some fair Athenian girl, perhaps,
    Upon her hand this gem displayed,
Nor thought that time's succeeding lapse
    Should see it grace a lovelier maid.

Look, dearest, what a sweet design!
    The more we gaze, it charms the more;
Come - closer bring that cheek to mine,
    And trace with me its beauties o'er.

Thou seest, it is a simple youth
    By some enamored nymph embraced -
Look, as she leans, and say in sooth
    Is not that hand most fondly placed?

Upon his curled head behind
    It seems in careless play to lie,
Yet presses gently, half inclined
    To bring the truant's lip more nigh.

Oh happy maid! Too happy boy!
    The one so fond and little loath,
The other yielding slow to joy -
    Oh rare, indeed, but blissful both.

Imagine, love, that I am he,
    And just as warm as he is chilling;
Imagine, too, that thou art she,
    But quite as coy as she is willing:

So may we try the graceful way
    In which their gentle arms are twined,
And thus, like her, my hand I lay
    Upon thy wreathed locks behind:

And thus I feel thee breathing sweet,
    As slow to mine thy head I move;
And thus our lips together meet,
    And thus, - and thus, - I kiss thee, love.

<nonum><center>* * * * *</center></nonum>

There's not a look, a word of thine,
    My soul hath e'er forgot;
Thou ne'er hast bid a ringlet shine,
Nor given thy locks one graceful twine
    Which I remember not.

There never yet a murmur fell
    From that beguiling tongue,
Which did not, with a lingering spell,
Upon thy charmed senses dwell,
    Like songs from Eden sung.

Ah! that I could, at once, forget
    All, all that haunts me so--
And yet, thou witching girl,--and yet,
To die were sweeter than to let
    The loved remembrance go.

No; if this slighted heart must see
    Its faithful pulse decay,
Oh let it die, remembering thee,
And, like the burnt aroma, be
    Consumed in sweets away.

Give me, my love, that billing kiss
I taught you one delicious night,
When, turning epicures in bliss,
We tried inventions of delight.

Come, gently steal my lips along,
And let your lips in murmurs move, -
Ah, no! - again - that kiss was wrong -
How can you be so dull, my love?

'Cease, cease!' the blushing girl replies -
And in her milky arms she caught me -
'How can you thus your pupil chide;
You know' twas in the dark you taught me!'

<body>
"They made her a grave, too cold and damp
    "For a soul so warm and true;
"And she's gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,
    "Where, all night long, by a firefly lamp,
"She paddles her white canoe.

"And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,
    "And her paddle I soon shall hear;
"Long and loving our life shall be,
"And I'll hide the maid in a cypress tree,
    "When the footstep of death is near."

Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds--
    His path was rugged and sore,
Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,
Through many a fen, where the serpent feeds,
    And man never trod before.

And, when on the earth he sunk to sleep
    If slumber his eyelids knew,
He lay, where the deadly vine doth weep
Its venomous tear and nightly steep
    The flesh with blistering dew!

And near him the she-wolf stirred the brake,
    And the copper-snake breathed in his ear,
Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,
"Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,
    "And the white canoe of my dear?"

He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright
    Quick over its surface played--
"Welcome," he said, "my dear one's light!"
And the dim shore echoed, for many a night,
    The name of the death-cold maid.

Till he hollowed a boat of the birchen bark,
    Which carried him off from shore;
Far, far he followed the meteor spark,
The wind was high and the clouds were dark,
    And the boat returned no more.

But oft, from the Indian hunter's camp
    This lover and maid so true
Are seen at the hour of midnight damp
To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,
    And paddle their white canoe!

The brilliant black eye

         The black eye may say,
         "Come and worship my ray--
"By adoring, perhaps you may move me!"
         But the blue eye, half hid,
         Says from under its lid,
"I love and am yours, if you love me!"
         Yes, Fanny!
         The blue eye, half hid,

"I love and am yours, if you love me!"

         Come tell me, then, why
         In that lovely blue eye
Not a charm of its tint I discover;
         Oh why should you wear
         The only blue pair
That ever said "No" to a lover?
        Dear Fanny!
        Oh, why should you wear

<body>
"Come, tell me," says Rosa, as kissing and kist,
    One day she reclined on my breast;
"Come, tell me the number, repeat me the list
    "Of the nymphs you have loved and carest."--
Oh Rosa! 'twas only my fancy that roved,
    My heart at the moment was free;
But I'll tell thee, my girl, how many I've loved,
    And the number shall finish with thee.

My tutor was Kitty; in infancy wild
    She taught me the way to be blest;
She taught me to love her, I loved like a child,
    But Kitty could fancy the rest.
This lesson of dear and enrapturing lore
    I have never forgot, I allow:
I have had it very often before,
    But never until now.

Pretty Martha was next, and my soul was all flame,
    But my head was so full of romance
That I fancied her into some chivalry dame,
    And I was her knight of the lance.
But Martha was not of this fanciful school,
    And she laughed at her poor little knight;
While I thought her a goddess, she thought me a fool,
    And I'll swear was most in the right.

My soul was now calm, till, by Cloris's looks,
    Again I was tempted to rove;
But Cloris, I found, was so learned in books
    That she gave me more logic than love.
So I left this young Sappho, and hastened to fly
    To those sweeter logicians in bliss,
Who argue the point with a soul-telling eye,
    And convince us at once with a kiss.

Oh! Susan was then all the world unto me,
    But Susan was piously given;
And the worst of it was, we could never agree
    On the road that was shortest to Heaven.
"Oh, Susan!" I've said, in the moments of mirth,
    "What's devotion to thee or to me?
"I devoutly believe there's a heaven on earth,
    "And believe that that heaven's in!"

Take back the kiss, that faithless sigh
With all the warmth of truth imprest:
Yet, no—the fatal kiss may lie,
Upon thy lip its sweets would die,
Or bloom to make a rival blest!

Take back the vows that, night and day
My heart received, I thought, from thine;
Yet, no—allow them still to stay,
They might some other heart betray,
As sweetly as they've ruin'd mine!

Dost thou remember that place so lonely,

Love bound us—never, never more to part!

And when I called thee by names the dearest
That love could fancy, the fondest, nearest,—
    "My life, my only life!" among the rest;
In those sweet accents that still enthral me,
Thou saidst, "Ah!" wherefore thy life thus call me?
    "Thy soul, thy soul's the name I love best;
"For life soon passes,—but how blest to be

I do confess, in many a sigh,
My lips have breath'd you many a lie,
And who, with such delights in view,
Would lose them for a lie or two?

Nay — look not thus, with brow reproving:
Lies are, my dear, the soul of loving!
If half we tell the girls were true,
If half we swear to think and do,
Were aught but lying's bright illusion,
The world would be in strange confusion!
If ladies' eyes were, every one,
As lovers swear, a radiant sun,
Astronomy should leave the skies,
To learn her lore in ladies' eyes!
Oh no! — believe me, lovely girl,
When nature turns your teeth to pearl,
Your neck to snow, your eyes to fire,
Your yellow locks to golden wire,
Then, only then, can heaven decree,
That you should live for only me,
Or I for you, as night and morn,
We've swearing kiss'd, and kissing sworn.

And now, my gentle hints to clear,
For once, I'll tell you truth, my dear!
Whenever you may chance to meet
A loving youth, whose love is sweet,
Long as you're false and he believes you,
Long as you trust and he deceives you,
So long the blissful bond endures;
And while he lies, his heart is yours:
But, oh! you've wholly lost the youth
The instant that he tells you truth!

Sweet soul! I did not.

Though gently bid not;

Oh! see those cherries—though once so glowing,

  Too soon they'll wither, too soon they'll fall. 
Once, caught by their blushes, the light bird flew round,
Oft on their ruby lips leaving love's wound;
  But now he passes them, ah! too knowing 
To taste wither'd cherries, when fresh may be found.

And thus thy beauties, now sunn'd and sunning,
  Would wither if left on the rose-tree too long. 
Then love while thou'rt lovely—e'en I should be glad 
So sweetly to save thee from ruin so sad;
  But, oh! delay not—we bards are too cunning 
To sigh for old beauties when young may be had.

Oh! had I leisure to sigh and mourn,
  Fanny, dearest, for thee I 'd sigh; 
And every smile on my cheek should turn 
  To tears when thou art nigh. 
But between love, and wine, and sleep, 
  So busy a life I live, 
That even the time it would take to weep 
  Is more than my heart can give. 
Then bid me not to despair and pine,
  Fanny, dearest of all the dears! 
The Love that's order'd to bathe in wine  
  Would be sure to take cold in tears.

Reflected bright in this heart of mine,
  Fanny, dearest, thy image lies; 
But oh, the mirror would cease to shine, 
   If dimm'd too often with sighs. 
They lose the half of beauty's light, 
  Who view it through sorrow's tear; 
And 'tis but to see thee truly bright 
  That I keep my eye-beam clear. 
Then wait no longer till tears shall flow, 
  Fanny, dearest—the hope is vain; 
If sunshine cannot dissolve thy snow, 
  I shall never attempt it with rain.

         Row gently here,

      So softly wake the tide, 
         That not an ear 
         On earth may hear, 
      But hers to whom we glide. 
Had Heaven but tongues to speak, as well 
      As starry eyes to see, 
Oh, think what tales 't would have to tell 
      Of wandering youths like me!

         Now rest thee here, 
         My gondolier; 
      Hush, hush, for up I go, 
         To climb yon light 
         Balcony's height, 
      While thou keep'st watch below. 
Ah! did we take for Heaven above 
      But half such pains as we 
Take, day and night, for woman's love, 
     What Angels we should be"

All that's bright must fade,—
The brightest still the fleetest;
All that's sweet was made
But to be lost when sweetest.
Stars that shine and fall;—
The flower that drops in springing;—
These, alas! are types of all
To which our hearts are clinging.
All that's bright must fade,—
The brightest still the fleetest;
All that's sweet was made
But to be lost when sweetest?

Who would seek our prize
Delights that end in aching?
Who would trust to ties
That every hour are breaking?
Better far to be
In utter darkness lying,
Than to be blest with light and see
That light for ever flying.
All that's bright must fade,—
The brightest still the fleetest;
All that's sweet was made
But to be lost when sweetest!

<body>
Reason and Folly and Beauty, they say,
Went on a party of pleasure one day:
        Folly played
        Around the maid,
The bells of his cap rung merrily out;
        While Reason took
        To his sermon-book—
Oh! which was the pleasanter no one need doubt,
Which was the pleasanter no one need doubt.

Beauty, who likes to be thought very sage.
Turned for a moment to Reason's dull page,
        Till Folly said,
        «Look here, sweet maid!»—
The sight of his cap brought her back to herself;
        While Reason read
        His leaves of lead,
With no one to mind him, poor sensible elf!
No,—no one to mind him, poor sensible elf!

Then Reason grew jealous of Folly's gay cap;
Had he that on, he her heart might entrap—
        «There it is,»
        Quoth Folly, «old quiz!»
(Folly was always good-natured, 'tis said,)
        «Under the sun
        There's no such fun,
As Reason with my cap and bells on his head!»
«Reason with my cap and bells on his head!»

But Reason the head-dress so awkwardly wore,
That Beauty now liked him still less than before;
        While Folly took
        Old Reason's book,
And twisted the leaves in a cap of such <i>ton</i>,
        That Beauty vowed
        (Tho' not aloud),
She liked him still better in that than his own,
Yes,—liked him still better in that than his own.

There comes a time, a dreary time,
To him whose heart hath flown
O'er all the fields of youth's sweet prime
And made each flower its own.
'Tis when his soul must first renounce
Those dreams so bright, so fond;
Oh! then's the time to die at once,
For Life has nought beyond.

When sets the sun on Afric's shore,
That instant all is night;
And so should life at once be o'er,
When Love withdraws his light -
Nor, like our northern day, gloom on
Through twilight's dim delay,
The cold remains of lustre gone,
Of fire long passed away.

<body>
Fly from the world, O Bessy! to me, 
Thou wilt never find any sincerer; 
I'll give up the world, O Bessy! for thee, 
I can never meet any that's dearer. 
Then tell me no more, with a tear and a sigh, 
That our loves will be censured by many; 
All, all have their follies, and who will deny 
That ours is the sweetest of any? 
When your lip has met mine, in communion so sweet, 
Have we felt as if virtue forbid it? — 
Have we felt as if heaven denied them to meet? — 
No, rather 't was heaven that did it. 
So innocent, love, is the joy we then sip, 
So little of wrong is there in it, 
That I wish all my errors were lodged on your lip, 
And I'd kiss them away in a minute. 

Then come to your lover, oh! fly to his shed, 
From a world which I know thou despisest; 
And slumber will hover as light o'er our bed 
As e'er on the couch of the wisest. 
And when o'er our pillow the tempest is driven, 
And thou, pretty innocent, fearest, 
I'll tell thee, it is not the chiding of heaven, 
'T is only our lullaby, dearest. 

And, oh! while we lie on our deathbed, my love, 
Looking back on the scene of our errors. 
A sigh from my Bessy shall plead then above, 
And Death be disarmed of his terrors, 
And each to the other embracing will say, 
" Farewell! let us hope we 're forgiven. " 
Thy last fading glance will illumine the way, 
And a kiss be our passport to heaven!

How sweetly could I lay my head 
  Within the cold grave's silent breast; 
Where Sorrow's tears no more are shed,
  No more the ills of life molest. 

For, ah! my heart, how very soon 
  The glitt'ring dreams of youth are past! 
And, long before it reach its noon,
  The sun of life is overcast.

Wake, my life! thy lover's arms
Are twined around thy sleeping charms:
Wake, my love! and let desire
Kindle those opening orbs of fire.

Yet, sweetest, though the bliss delight thee,
If the guilt, the shame affright thee,
Still those orbs in darkness keep;
Sleep, my girl, or <i>seem to sleep.</i>

My heart is united to Chloe's for ever, 
No time shall the link of their tenderness sever, 
And, if Love be the parent of joy and of pleasure, 
Chloe and I shall be blest beyond measure. 

Come, tell me, my girl, what's the sweetest of blisses? 
''I'll show you,'' she cries, and she gives me sweet kisses; 
Ah, Clo' if that languishing eye's not a traitor, 
It tells me you know of a bliss that is greater. 

''Indeed, and I do not,'' then softly she blushes, 
And her bosom the warm tint of modesty flushes; 
''I'm sure if I knew it, I'd certainly show it, 
''But Damon, dear, may be you know it."

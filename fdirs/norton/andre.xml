<poetry> 
<sc>We</sc> have been friends together, 
  In sunshine and in shade; 
Since first beneath the chestnut-trees 
  In infancy we played. 
But coldness dwells within thy heart, 
  A cloud is on thy brow; 
We have been friends together— 
  Shall a light word part us now? 

We have been gay together; 
  We have laugh’d at little jests; 
For the fount of hope was gushing 
  Warm and joyous in our breasts. 
But laughter now hath fled thy lip, 
  And sullen glooms thy brow; 
We have been gay together— 
  Shall a light word part us now? 

We have been sad together, 
  We have wept, with bitter tears, 
O’er the grass-grown graves, where slumber’d 
  The hopes of early years.
The voices which are silent there 
  Would bid thee clear thy brow; 
We have been sad together— 
  Oh! what shall part us now?

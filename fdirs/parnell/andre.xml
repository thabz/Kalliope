<body>
  When thy beauty appears,
  In its graces and airs,
All bright as an angel new dropt from the sky;
  At distance I gaze, and am awed by my fears,
So strangely you dazzle my eye!

  But when without art,
  Your kind thoughts you impart,
When your love runs in blushes through every vein;
  When it darts from your eyes, when it pants in your heart,
Then I know you're a woman again.

  There's a passion and pride
  In our sex (she replied),
And thus (might I gratify both) I would do:
  Still an angel appear to each lover beside,
But still be a woman to you.

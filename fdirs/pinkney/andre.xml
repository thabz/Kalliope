<poetry>
I burn no incense, hang no wreath,
  On this, thine early tomb:
Such cannot cheer the place of death,
  But only mock its gloom.
Here odorous smoke and breathing flower
  No grateful influence shed;
They lose their perfume and their power,
  When offered to the dead.

And if, as is the Afghaun's creed,
  The spirit may return,
A disembodied sense to feed,
  On fragrance, near its urnâ€”
It is enough, that she, whom thou
  Did'st love in living years,
Sits desolate beside it now,
  And falls these heavy tears.

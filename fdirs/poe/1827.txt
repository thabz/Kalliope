VN:Denne digtsamling, som lang tid efter <I>Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems</I> (1829), der betragtes som Poes egentlige debut, var slet ikke bekendt, og først efter 1876, hvor der blev fundet et eksemplar på British Museums bibliotek, anerkendte man eksistensen af denne tidlige digtsamling. I 1890 fandt man et andet eksemplar, og efter det hævdes der, at der har været op til 200 kopier. I dag kendes kun 12 eksemplarer, hvoraf flere er i dårlig stand. Udgaven her stammer fra faksimiler. Dette er altså førsteudgaven.

T:Preface
TYPE:prosa

THE greater part of the Poems which compose this little volume, were written in the year 1821-2, when the author had not completed his fourteenth year.  They were of course not intended for publication ; why they are now published concerns no one but himself.  Of the smaller pieces very little need be said ; they perhaps savour too much of Egotism ; but they were written by one too young to have any knowledge of the world but from his own breast. 

In Tamerlane, he has endeavoured to expose the folly of even <I>risking</I> the best feelings of the heart at the shrine of Ambition.  He is conscious that in this there are many faults, (besides that of the general character of the poem) which he flatters himself he could, with little trouble, have corrected, but unlike many of his predecessors, has been too fond of his early productions to amend them in his <I>old age</I>.

He will not say that he is indifferent as to the success of these Poems - it might stimulate him to other attempts - but he can safely assert that failure will not at all influence him in a resolution already adopted.  This is challenging criticism - let it be so.  <I>Nos hæc novimus esse nihil</I><footnote>Den sidste linie er fra Martials 13. bog, 2. epigram, vers 2.

T:Tamerlane
F:I have sent for thee, holy friar

I.

    I have sent for thee, holy friar;
But 'twas not with the drunken hope, 
Which is but agony of desire 
To shun the fate, with which to cope 
Is more than crime may dare to dream, 
That I have call'd thee at this hour: 
Such father is not my theme - 
Nor am I mad, to deem that power 
Of earth may shrive me of the sin 
Unearthly pride hath revell'd in - 
I would not call thee fool, old man, 
But hope is not a gift of thine; 
If I can hope (O God! I can) 
It falls from an eternal shrine.

II.

    The gay wall of this gaudy tower 
Grows dim around me - death is near. 
I had not thought, until this hour 
When passing from the earth, that ear 
Of any, were it not the shade 
Of one whom in life I made 
All mystery but a simple name, 
Might know the secret of a spirit 
Bow'd down in sorrow, and in shame. - 
Shame said'st thou? 

                         Aye I did inherit 
That hatred portion, with the fame, 
The worldly glory, which has shown 
A demon-light around my throne, 
Scorching my sear'd heart with a pain 
Not Hell shall make me fear again.

III.

    I have not always been as now - 
The fever'd diadem on my brow 
I claim'd and won usurpingly - 
Aye - the same heritage hath giv'n 
Rome to the Cæsar - this to me; 
The heirdom of a kingly mind - 
And a proud spirit, which hath striv'n 
Triumphantly with human kind. 

    In mountain air I first drew life; 
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews on my young head; 
And my brain drank their venom then, 
When after day of perilous strife 
With chamois, I would seize his den 
And slumber, in my pride of power, 
The infant monarch of the hour - 
For, with the mountain dew by night, 
My soul imbib'd unhallow'd feeling; 
And I would feel its essence stealing 
In dreams upon me - while the light 
Flashing from cloud that hover'd o'er, 
Would seem to my half closing eye 
The pageantry of monarchy! 
And the deep thunder's echoing roar 
Came hurriedly upon me, telling 
Of war, and tumult, where my voice 
My <I>own</I> voice, silly child! was swelling 
(O how would my wild heart rejoice 
And leap within me at the cry) 
The battle-cry of victory! 
  
   *      *      *      *      * 

IV.

    The rain came down upon my head 
But barely shelter'd - and the wind 
Pass'd quickly o'er me - but my mind
Was mad'ning - for 'twas man that shed 
Laurels upon me - and the rush, 
The torrent of the chilly air 
Gurgled in my pleas'd ear the crash 
Of empires, with the captive's prayer, 
The hum of suitors, the mix'd tone 
Of flatt'ry round a sov'reign's throne.

    The storm had ceas'd - and I awoke - 
Its spirit cradled me to sleep, 
And as it pass'd me by, there broke 
Strange light upon me, tho' it were 
My soul in mystery to sleep:
For I was not as I had been; 
The child of Nature, without care, 
Or thought, save of the passing scene. -

V.

    My passions, from that hapless hour, 
Usurp'd a tyranny, which men 
Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power 
My innate nature - be it so: 
But, father, there liv'd one who, then - 
Then, in my boyhood, when their fire 
Burn'd with a still intenser glow; 
(For passion must with youth expire) 
Ev'n <I>then</I>, who deem'd this iron heart
In woman's weakness had a part.

    I have no words, alas! to tell 
The lovliness of loving well! 
Nor would I dare attempt to trace 
The breathing beauty of a face, 
Which ev'n to <I>my</I> impassion'd mind, 
Leaves not its memory behind. 
In spring of life have ye ne'er dwelt 
Some object of delight upon, 
With steadfast eye, till ye have felt 
The earth reel - and the vision gone? 
And I have held to mem'ry's eye 
One object - and but one - until 
Its very form hath pass'd me by, 
But left its influence with me still. 

VI.

    'Tis not to thee that I should name - 
Thou can'st not -would'st not dare to think 
The magic empire of a flame 
Which ev'n upon this perilous brink 
Hath fix'd my soul, tho' unforgiv'n 
By what it lost for passion - Heav'n. 
I lov'd - and O, how tenderly! 
Yes! she was worthy of all love! 
Such as in infancy was mine
Tho' then its <I>passion</I> could not be: 
'Twas such as angel minds above 
Might envy - her young heart the shrine 
On which my ev'ry hope and thought 
Were incense - then a goodly gift - 
For they were childish, without sin, 
Pure as her young examples taught; 
Why did I leave it and adrift, 
Trust to the fickle star within

VII. 

    We grew in age, and love together, 
Roaming the forest and the wild; 
My breast her shield in wintry weather, 
And when the friendly sunshine smil'd 
And she would mark the op'ning skies, 
I saw no Heav'n, but in her eyes - 
Ev'n childhood knows the human heart; 
For when, in sunshine and in smiles, 
From all our little cares apart, 
Laughing at her half silly wiles, 
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast, 
And pour my spirit out in tears, 
She'd look up in my wilder'd eye - 
There was no need to speak the rest - 
No need to quiet her kind fears - 
She did not ask the reason why. 
 
    The hallow'd mem'ry of those years 
Comes o'er me in these lonely hours, 
And, with sweet lovliness, appears 
As perfume of strange summer flow'rs; 
Of flow'rs which we have known before 
In infancy, which seen, recall 
To mind - not flow'rs alone - but more 
Our earthly life, and love - and all.

VIII. 

    Yes! she was worthy of all love! 
Ev'n such as from th' accursed time 
My spirit with the tempest strove, 
When on the mountain peak alone, 
Ambition lent it a new tone, 
And bade it first to dream of crime, 
My phrenzy to her bosom taught: 
We still were young: no purer thought 
Dwell in a seraph's breast than thine;
For passionate love is still divine: 
<I>I</I> lov'd her as an angel might 
With ray of the all living light 
Which blazes upon Edis' shrine.
It is not surely sin to name, 
With such as mine - that mystic flame, 
I had no being but in thee! 
The world with all its train of bright
And happy beauty (for to me 
All was an undefin'd delight) 
The world - its joy - its share of pain 
Which I felt not - its bodied forms 
Of varied being, which contain 
The bodiless spirits of the storms, 
The sunshine, and the calm - the ideal 
And fleeting vanities of dreams, 
Fearfully beautiful! the real 
Nothings of mid-day waking life - 
Of an enchanted life, which seems, 
Now as I look back, the strife 
Of some ill demon, with a power 
Which left me in an evil hour, 
All that I felt, or saw, or thought, 
Crowding, confused became 
(With thine unearthly beauty fraught) 
Thou - and the nothing of a name.

IX. 

    The passionate spirit which hath known, 
And deeply felt the silent tone 
Of its own self supremacy, - 
(I speak thus openly to thee, 
'Twere folly <I>now</I> to veil a thought 
With which this aching, breast is fraught) 
The soul which feels its innate right -
The mystic empire and high power 
Giv'n by the energetic might 
Of Genius, at its natal hour; 
Which knows (believe me at this time, 
When falsehood were a ten-fold crime, 
There is a power in the high spirit 
To <I>know</I> the fate it will inherit) 
The soul, which knows such power, will still 
Find <I>Pride</I> the ruler of its will.

    Yes! I was proud - and ye who know 
The magic of that meaning word, 
So oft perverted, will bestow 
Your scorn, perhaps, when ye have heard 
That the proud spirit had been broken, 
The proud heart burst in agony 
At one upbraiding word or token 
Of her that heart's idolatry - 
I was ambitious - have ye known 
Its fiery passion? - ye have not - 
A cottager, I mark'd a throne 
Of half the world, as all my own, 
And murmur'd at such lowly lot! 
But it had pass'd me as a dream 
Which, of light step, flies with the dew, 
That kindling thought - did not the beam 
Of Beauty, which did guide it through
The livelong summer day, oppress 
My mind with double loveliness - 
     *       *       *       *       * 

X. 

    We walk'd together on the crown 
Of a high mountain, which look'd down 
Afar from its proud natural towers 
Of rock and forest, on the hills - 
The dwindled hills, whence amid bowers 
Her own fair hand had rear'd around, 
Gush'd shoutingly a thousand rills, 
Which as it were, in fairy bound 
Embrac'd two hamlets - those our own - 
Peacefully happy - yet alone - 

     *       *       *       *       * 

    I spoke to her of power and pride - 
But mystically, in such guise, 
That she might deem it naught beside 
The moment's converse, in her eyes 
I read (perhaps too carelessly) 
A mingled feeling with my own; 
The flush on her bright cheek, to me, 
Seem'd to become a queenly throne 
Too well, that I should let it be 
A light in the dark wild, alone. 

XI. 

    There - in that hour - a thought came o'er 
My mind, it had not known before - 
To leave her while we both were young, - 
To follow my high fate among 
The strife of nations, and redeem 
The idle words, which, as a dream 
Now sounded to her heedless ear - 
I held no doubt - I knew no fear 
Of peril in my wild career; 
To gain an empire, and throw down 
As nuptial dowry - a queen's crown, 
The only feeling which possest, 
With her own image, my fond breast - 
Who, that had known the secret thought 
Of a young peasant's bosom then, 
Had deem'd him, in compassion, aught 
But one, whom phantasy had led 
Astray from reason - Among men 
Ambition is chain'd down - nor fed 
(As in the desert, where the grand, 
The wild, the beautiful, conspire 
With their own breath to fan its fire) 
With thoughts such feeling can command; 
Uncheck'd by sarcasm, and scorn 
Of those, who hardly will conceive
That any should become "great," born
In their own sphere - will not believe 
That they shall stoop in life to one 
Whom daily they are wont to see 
Familiarly - whom Fortune's sun 
Hath ne'er shone dazzlingly upon 
Lowly - and of their own degree -

XII. 

    I pictur'd to my fancy's eye 
Her silent, deep astonishment, 
When, a few fleeting years gone by, 
(For short the time my high hope lent 
To its most desperate intent,) 
She might recall in him, whom Fame 
Had gilded with a conquerer's name, 
(With glory - such as might inspire 
Perforce, a passing thought of one, 
Whom she had deem'd in his own fire 
Wither'd and blasted; who had gone 
A traitor, violate of the truth 
So plighted in his early youth,) 
Her own Alexis, who should plight
The love he plighted <I>then</I> - again, 
And raise his infancy's delight, 
The bride and queen of Tamerlane - 

XIII. 

    One noon of a bright summer's day 
I pass'd from out the matted bow'r 
Where in a deep, still slumber lay 
My Ada. In that peaceful hour, 
A silent gaze was my farewell. 
I had no other solace - then 
T'awake her, and a falsehood tell 
Of a feign'd journey, were again 
To trust the weakness of my heart 
To her soft thrilling voice:  To part 
Thus, haply, while in sleep she dream'd 
Of long delight, nor yet had deem'd 
Awake, that I had held a thought 
Of parting, were with madness fraught; 
I knew not woman's heart, alas! 
Tho' lov'd, and loving - let it pass. - 

XIV. 

    I went from out the matted bow'r, 
And hurried madly on my way: 
And felt, with ev'ry flying hour, 
That bore me from my home, more gay; 
There is of earth an agony 
Which, ideal, still may be 
The worst ill of mortality, 
'Tis bliss, in its own reality,
Too real, to <I>his</I> breast who lives 
Not within himself but gives 
A portion of his willing soul 
To God, and to the great whole - 
To him, whose loving spirit will dwell 
With Nature, in her wild paths; tell 
Of her wond'rous ways, and telling bless 
Her overpow'ring loveliness! 
A more than agony to him 
Whose failing sight will grow dim 
With its own living gaze upon 
That loveliness around: the sun - 
The blue sky - the misty light 
Of the pale cloud therein, whose hue 
Is grace to its heav'nly bed of blue; 
Dim! tho' looking on all bright! 
O God! when the thoughts that may not pass 
Will burst upon him, and alas! 
For the flight on Earth to Fancy giv'n, 
There are no words -- unless of Heav'n. 
                         
XV. 
  
      *      *      *      *      *      * 

    Look 'round thee now on Samarcand,
Is she not queen of earth? her pride 
Above all cities? in her hand 
Their destinies? with all beside
Of glory, which the world hath known? 
Stands she not proudly and alone? 
And who her sov'reign? Timur he
Whom th' astonish'd earth hath seen, 
With victory, on victory, 
Redoubling age! and more, I ween, 
The Zinghis' yet re-echoing fame.
And now what has he? what! a name. 
The sound of revelry by night 
Comes o'er me, with the mingled voice 
Of many with a breast as light, 
As if 'twere not the dying hour 
Of one, in whom they did rejoice - 
As in a leader, haply - Power 
Its venom secretly imparts; 
Nothing have I with human hearts. 

XVI. 

    When Fortune mark'd me for her own, 
And my proud hopes had reach'd a throne 
(It boots me not, good friar, to tell 
A tale the world but knows too well, 
How by what hidden deeds of might, 
I clamber'd to the tottering height,) 
I still was young; and well I ween 
My spirit what it e'er had been. 
My eyes were still on pomp and power,
My wilder'd heart was far away, 
In vallies of the wild Taglay, 
In mine own Ada's matted bow'r. 
I dwelt not long in Samarcand 
Ere, in a peasant's lowly guise, 
I sought my long-abandon'd land, 
By sunset did its mountains rise 
In dusky grandeur to my eyes: 
But as I wander'd on the way 
My heart sunk with the sun's ray. 
To him, who still would gaze upon 
The glory of the summer sun, 
There comes, when that sun will from him part, 
A sullen hopelessness of heart. 
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist 
So often lovely, and will lisp 
To the sound of the coming darkness (known 
To those whose spirits hark'n)  as one
Who in a dream of night <I>would</I> fly 
But cannot from a danger nigh. 
What though the moon - the silvery moon 
Shine on his path, in her high noon; 
<I>Her</I> smile is chilly, and <I>her</I> beam 
In that time of dreariness will seem 
As the portrait of one after death; 
A likeness taken when the breath
Of young life, and the fire o' the eye 
<I>Had</I> lately been but had pass'd by. 
'Tis thus when the lovely summer sun 
Of our boyhood, his course hath run: 
For all we live to know - is known; 
And all we seek to keep - hath flown; 
With the noon-day beauty, which is all. 
Let life, then, as the day-flow'r, fall - 
The trancient, passionate day-flow'r,
Withering at the ev'ning hour.

XVII.

    I reach'd my home - my home no more - 
For all was flown that made it so - 
I pass'd from out its mossy door, 
In vacant idleness of woe. 
There met me on its threshold stone 
A mountain hunter, I had known 
In childhood but he knew me not. 
Something he spoke of the old cot: 
It had seen better days, he said; 
<I>There</I> rose a fountain once, and <I>there</I> 
Full many a fair flow'r rais'd its head: 
But she who rear'd them was long dead, 
And in such follies had no part, 
What was there left me <I>now</I>? despair - 
A kingdom for a broken - heart.

F:I saw thee on the bridal day

I saw thee on the bridal day; 
    When a burning blush came o'er thee, 
Tho' Happiness around thee lay, 
    The world all love before thee.

And, in thine eye, the kindling light 
    Of young passion free 
Was all on earth, my chain'd sight 
   Of Loveliness might see. 

That blush, I ween, was maiden shame: 
    As such it well may pass: 
Tho' its glow hath rais'd a fiercer flame 
    In the breast of him, alas! 

Who saw the on that bridal day,<footnote>giver ikke rigtig mening; der menes nok 'thee'. Cf. digtets første vers.</footnote>

T:Dreams
F:Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream !

Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream ! 
My spirit not awak'ning, till the beam 
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow. 
Yes ! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow. 
‘Twere better than the cold reality 
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be, 
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth, 
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth. 
But should it be - that dream eternally 
Continuing - as dreams have been to me 
In my young boyhood - should it thus be giv'n 
‘Twere folly still to hope for higher Heav'n. 
For I have revell'd when the sun was bright 
In the summer sky, in dreams of living light. 
And loveliness, - have left my very heart 
Inclines of mine imaginary apart 
From mine own home, with beings that have been 
Of mine own thought - what more could I have seen ? 
‘Twas once - and only once - and the wild hour 
From my remembrance shall not pass - some pow'r 
Or spell had bound me - 'twas the chilly wind 
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind 
Its image on my spirit - or the moon 
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly - or the stars - howe'er it was 
That dream was as that night-wind - let it pass. 
I have <I>been</I> happy, tho' in a dream. 
I have been happy - and I  love the theme : 
Dreams ! in their vivid colouring of life 
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife 
Of semblance with reality which brings 
To the delirious eye, more lovely things 
Of Paradise and Love - and all our own ! 
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

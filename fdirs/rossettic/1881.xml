Oh why is heaven built so far,
         Oh why is earth set so remote?
I cannot reach the nearest star
         That hangs afloat.

I would not care to reach the moon,
         One round monotonous of change;
Yet even she repeats her tune
         Beyond my range.

I never watch the scatter'd fire
       Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train,
But all my heart is one desire,
       And all in vain:

For I am bound with fleshly bands,
       Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;
I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,
       And catch at hope.

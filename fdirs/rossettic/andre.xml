All the world is making love:
Bird to bird in bushes,
Beast to beast in glades, and frog
To frog among the rushes:
Wake, O south wind sweet with spice
Wake the rose to blushes.

<body>
Come to me in the silence of the night;
   Come in the sparkling silence of a dream;
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
   As sunlight on a stream;
     Come back in tears,
O memory, hope, love of finished years.

O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
   Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;
   Where thirsting longing eyes
     Watch the slow door
That opening, letting in, lets out no more.

Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
   My very life again though cold in death:
Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
   Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
     Speak low, lean low,
As long ago, my love, how long ago.

<body>
     My heart is like a singing bird
         Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
     My heart is like an apple-tree
         Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
     My heart is like a rainbow shell
         That paddles in a halcyon sea;
     My heart is gladder than all these
         Because my love is come to me.

     Raise me a dais of silk and down;
       Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
     Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
       And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
     Work it in gold and silver grapes,
       In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
     Because the birthday of my life
       Is come, my love is come to me.

<body>
     A fool I was to sleep at noon,
         And wake when night is chilly
     Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
     A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
         A fool to snap my lily.

     My garden-plot I have not kept;
         Faded and all-forsaken,
     I weep as I have never wept:
     Oh it was summer when I slept,
         It's winter now I waken.

     Talk what you please of future spring
         And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:--
     Stripp'd bare of hope and everything,
     No more to laugh, no more to sing,
         I sit alone with sorrow.

<body>
Where sunless rivers weep
Their waves into the deep,
She sleeps a charmed sleep:
    Awake her not.
Led by a single star,
She came from very far
To seek where shadows are
    Her pleasant lot.

She left the rosy morn,
She left the fields of corn,
For twilight cold and lorn
    And water springs.
Through sleep, as through a veil,
She sees the sky look pale,
And hears the nightingale
    That sadly sings.

Rest, rest, a perfect rest
Shed over brow and breast;
Her face is toward the west,
    The purple land.
She cannot see the grain
Ripening on hill and plain;
She cannot feel the rain
    Upon her hand.

Rest, rest, for evermore
Upon a mossy shore;
Rest, rest at the heart's core
    Till time shall cease:
Sleep that no pain shall wake;
Night that no morn shall break
Till joy shall overtake
    Her perfect peace.

<body>
     Does the road wind up-hill all the way?
         Yes, to the very end.
     Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
         From morn to night, my friend.

     But is there for the night a resting-place?
         A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.
     May not the darkness hide it from my face?
         You cannot miss that inn.

     Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
         Those who have gone before.
     Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
         They will not keep you standing at that door.

     Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
         Of labour you shall find the sum.
     Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
         Yea, beds for all who come.

   <title>Sleeping At Last</title>
   <firstline>Sleeping at last, the trouble and tumult over</firstline>
</head>
<body>
Sleeping at last, the trouble and tumult over, 
Sleeping at last, the struggle and horror past, 
Cold and white, out of sight of friend and of lover, 
    Sleeping at last.

No more a tired heart downcast or overcast, 
No more pangs that wring or shifting fears that hover, 
Sleeping at last in a dreamless sleep locked fast.

Fast asleep. Singing birds in their leafy cover 
Cannot wake her, nor shake her the gusty blast. 
Under the purple thyme and the purple clover 
    Sleeping at last.

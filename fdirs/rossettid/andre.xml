<i>“How should I your true love know</i>
    <i>From another one?”</i>
<i>“By his cockle-hat and staff</i>
    <i>And his sandal-shoon.”</i>

“And what signs have told you now
    That he hastens home?”
“Lo! the spring is nearly gone,
    He is nearly come.”
    
“For a token is there nought,
    Say, that he should bring?”
“He will bear a ring I gave
    And another ring.”

“How may I, when he shall ask,
    Tell him who lies there?”
“Nay, but leave my face unveiled
    And unbound my hair.”

“Can you say to me some word
    I shall say to him?”
“Say I'm looking in his eyes
    Though my eyes are dim.”

Ah! County Guy, the hour is nigh,
    The sun has left the lea,
The orange flower perfumes the bower,
    The breeze is on the sea.
The lark his lay who thrill'd all day
    Sits hush'd his partner nigh:
Breeze, bird, and flower confess the hour,
    But where is County Guy?

The village maid steals through the shade,
    Her shepherd's suit to hear;
To beauty shy, by lattice high,
    Sings high-born Cavalier.
The star of Love, all stars above
    Now reigns o'er earth and sky;
And high and low the influence know--
    But where is County Guy?

   <firstline>Why weep ye by the tide, ladie</firstline>

<body>
"Why weep ye by the tide, ladie?
    Why weep ye by the tide?
I'll wed ye to my youngest son,
    And ye sall be his bride:
And ye sall be his bride, ladie,
    Sae comely to be seen"--
But aye she loot the tears down fa'
    For Jock of Hazeldean.

"Now let this wilful grief be done,
    And dry that cheek so pale;
Young Frank is chief of Errington,
    And lord of Langley-dale;
His step is first in peaceful ha',
    His sword in battle keen"--
But aye she loot the tears down fa'
    For Jock of Hazeldean.

"A chain of gold ye sall not lack,
    Nor braid to bind your hair;
Nor mettled hound, nor managed hawk,
    Nor palfrey fresh and fair;
And you, the foremost o' them a',
    Shall ride our forest queen"--
But aye she loot the tears down fa'
    For Jock of Hazeldean.

The kirk was deck'd at morning-tide,
    The tapers glimmer'd fair;
The priest and bridegroom wait the bride,
    And dame and knight are there.
They sought her baith by bower and ha';
    The ladie was not seen!
She's o'er the Border and awa'
    Wi' Jock of Hazeldean.

   <firstline>O hush thee, my babie, thy sire was a knight</firstline>

<body>
  O hush thee, my babie, thy sire was a knight,
Thy mother a lady, both lovely and bright;
The woods and the glens, from the towers which we see,
They all are belonging, dear babie, to thee.
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.

  O fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows,
It calls but the warders that guard thy repose;
Their bows would be bended, their blades would be red,
Ere the step of a foeman drew near to thy bed.
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.

  O hush thee, my babie, the time soon will come
When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may,
For strife comes with manhood, and waking with day.
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
       O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.

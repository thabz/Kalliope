<sc>Not</sc>, Celia, that I juster am 
    Or better than the rest! 
For I would change each hour, like them, 
    Were not my heart at rest. 

But I am tied to very thee 
    By every thought I have; 
Thy face I only care to see, 
    Thy heart I only crave. 

All that in woman is adored 
    In thy dear self I find-- 
For the whole sex can but afford 
    The handsome and the kind. 

Why then should I seek further store, 
    And still make love anew? 
When change itself can give no more, 
    'Tis easy to be true!

I

The fountains mingle with the river
   And the rivers with the Ocean,
The winds of Heaven mix for ever
   With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
   All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
   Why not I with thine? -

II

See the mountains kiss high Heaven
   And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
   If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea:
What is all this sweet work worth
   If thou kiss not me?

<nonum>PART 1.</nonum>

A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew,
And the young winds fed it with silver dew,
And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light.
And closed them beneath the kisses of Night.

And the Spring arose on the garden fair,
Like the Spirit of Love felt everywhere;
And each flower and herb on Earth's dark breast
Rose from the dreams of its wintry rest.

But none ever trembled and panted with bliss
In the garden, the field, or the wilderness,
Like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want,
As the companionless Sensitive Plant.

The snowdrop, and then the violet,
Arose from the ground with warm rain wet,
And their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sent
From the turf, like the voice and the instrument.

Then the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall,
And narcissi, the fairest among them all,
Who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess,
Till they die of their own dear loveliness;

And the Naiad-like lily of the vale,
Whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale
That the light of its tremulous bells is seen
Through their pavilions of tender green;

And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue,
Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew
Of music so delicate, soft, and intense,
It was felt like an odour within the sense;

And the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed,
Which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast,
Till, fold after fold, to the fainting air
The soul of her beauty and love lay bare:

And the wand-like lily, which lifted up,
As a Maenad, its moonlight-coloured cup,
Till the fiery star, which is its eye,
Gazed through clear dew on the tender sky;

And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose,
The sweetest flower for scent that blows;
And all rare blossoms from every clime
Grew in that garden in perfect prime.

And on the stream whose inconstant bosom
Was pranked, under boughs of embowering blossom,
With golden and green light, slanting through
Their heaven of many a tangled hue,

Broad water-lilies lay tremulously,
And starry river-buds glimmered by,
And around them the soft stream did glide and dance
With a motion of sweet sound and radiance.

And the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss,
Which led through the garden along and across,
Some open at once to the sun and the breeze,
Some lost among bowers of blossoming trees,

Were all paved with daisies and delicate bells
As fair as the fabulous asphodels,
And flow'rets which, drooping as day drooped too,
Fell into pavilions, white, purple, and blue,
To roof the glow-worm from the evening dew.

And from this undefiled Paradise
The flowers (as an infant's awakening eyes
Smile on its mother, whose singing sweet
Can first lull, and at last must awaken it),

When Heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them,
As mine-lamps enkindle a hidden gem,
Shone smiling to Heaven, and every one
Shared joy in the light of the gentle sun;

For each one was interpenetrated
With the light and the odour its neighbour shed,
Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear
Wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere.

But the Sensitive Plant which could give small fruit
Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root,
Received more than all, it loved more than ever,
Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver,—

For the Sensitive Plant has no bright flower;
Radiance and odour are not its dower;
It loves, even like Love, its deep heart is full,
It desires what it has not, the Beautiful!

The light winds which from unsustaining wings
Shed the music of many murmurings;
The beams which dart from many a star
Of the flowers whose hues they bear afar;

The plumed insects swift and free,
Like golden boats on a sunny sea,
Laden with light and odour, which pass
Over the gleam of the living grass;

The unseen clouds of the dew, which lie
Like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high,
Then wander like spirits among the spheres,
Each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears;

The quivering vapours of dim noontide,
Which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide,
In which every sound, and odour, and beam,
Move, as reeds in a single stream;

Each and all like ministering angels were
For the Sensitive Plant sweet joy to bear,
Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by
Like windless clouds o'er a tender sky.

And when evening descended from Heaven above,
And the Earth was all rest, and the air was all love,
And delight, though less bright, was far more deep,
And the day's veil fell from the world of sleep,

And the beasts, and the birds, and the insects were drowned
In an ocean of dreams without a sound;
Whose waves never mark, though they ever impress
The light sand which paves it, consciousness;

(Only overhead the sweet nightingale
Ever sang more sweet as the day might fail,
And snatches of its Elysian chant
Were mixed with the dreams of the Sensitive Plant);—

The Sensitive Plant was the earliest
Upgathered into the bosom of rest;
A sweet child weary of its delight,
The feeblest and yet the favourite,
Cradled within the embrace of Night.


<nonum>PART 2.</nonum>

There was a Power in this sweet place,
An Eve in this Eden; a ruling Grace
Which to the flowers, did they waken or dream,
Was as God is to the starry scheme.

A Lady, the wonder of her kind,
Whose form was upborne by a lovely mind
Which, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion
Like a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean,

Tended the garden from morn to even:
And the meteors of that sublunar Heaven,
Like the lamps of the air when Night walks forth,
Laughed round her footsteps up from the Earth!

She had no companion of mortal race,
But her tremulous breath and her flushing face
Told, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes,
That her dreams were less slumber than Paradise:

As if some bright Spirit for her sweet sake
Had deserted Heaven while the stars were awake,
As if yet around her he lingering were,
Though the veil of daylight concealed him from her.

Her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed;
You might hear by the heaving of her breast,
That the coming and going of the wind
Brought pleasure there and left passion behind.

And wherever her aery footstep trod,
Her trailing hair from the grassy sod
Erased its light vestige, with shadowy sweep,
Like a sunny storm o'er the dark green deep.

I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet
Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;
I doubt not they felt the spirit that came
From her glowing fingers through all their frame.

She sprinkled bright water from the stream
On those that were faint with the sunny beam;
And out of the cups of the heavy flowers
She emptied the rain of the thunder-showers.

She lifted their heads with her tender hands,
And sustained them with rods and osier-bands;
If the flowers had been her own infants, she
Could never have nursed them more tenderly.

And all killing insects and gnawing worms,
And things of obscene and unlovely forms,
She bore, in a basket of Indian woof,
Into the rough woods far aloof,—

In a basket, of grasses and wild-flowers full,
The freshest her gentle hands could pull
For the poor banished insects, whose intent,
Although they did ill, was innocent.

But the bee and the beamlike ephemeris
Whose path is the lightning's, and soft moths that kiss
The sweet lips of the flowers, and harm not, did she
Make her attendant angels be.

And many an antenatal tomb,
Where butterflies dream of the life to come,
She left clinging round the smooth and dark
Edge of the odorous cedar bark.

This fairest creature from earliest Spring
Thus moved through the garden ministering
Mi the sweet season of Summertide,
And ere the first leaf looked brown—she died!

<nonum>PART 3.</nonum>

Three days the flowers of the garden fair,
Like stars when the moon is awakened, were,
Or the waves of Baiae, ere luminous
She floats up through the smoke of Vesuvius.

And on the fourth, the Sensitive Plant
Felt the sound of the funeral chant,
And the steps of the bearers, heavy and slow,
And the sobs of the mourners, deep and low;

The weary sound and the heavy breath,
And the silent motions of passing death,
And the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank,
Sent through the pores of the coffin-plank;

The dark grass, and the flowers among the grass,
Were bright with tears as the crowd did pass;
From their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone,
And sate in the pines, and gave groan for groan.

The garden, once fair, became cold and foul,
Like the corpse of her who had been its soul,
Which at first was lovely as if in sleep,
Then slowly changed, till it grew a heap
To make men tremble who never weep.

Swift Summer into the Autumn flowed,
And frost in the mist of the morning rode,
Though the noonday sun looked clear and bright,
Mocking the spoil of the secret night.

The rose-leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,
Paved the turf and the moss below.
The lilies were drooping, and white, and wan,
Like the head and the skin of a dying man.

And Indian plants, of scent and hue
The sweetest that ever were fed on dew,
Leaf by leaf, day after day,
Were massed into the common clay.

And the leaves, brown, yellow, and gray, and red,
And white with the whiteness of what is dead,
Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed;
Their whistling noise made the birds aghast.

And the gusty winds waked the winged seeds,
Out of their birthplace of ugly weeds,
Till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem,
Which rotted into the earth with them.

The water-blooms under the rivulet
Fell from the stalks on which they were set;
And the eddies drove them here and there,
As the winds did those of the upper air.

Then the rain came down, and the broken stalks
Were bent and tangled across the walks;
And the leafless network of parasite bowers
Massed into ruin; and all sweet flowers.

Between the time of the wind and the snow
All loathliest weeds began to grow,
Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,
Like the water-snake's belly and the toad's back.

And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank,
And the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,
Stretched out its long and hollow shank,
And stifled the air till the dead wind stank.

And plants, at whose names the verse feels loath,
Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,
Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,
Livid, and starred with a lurid dew.

And agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould
Started like mist from the wet ground cold;
Pale, fleshy, as if the decaying dead
With a spirit of growth had been animated!

Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,
Made the running rivulet thick and dumb,
And at its outlet flags huge as stakes
Dammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes.

And hour by hour, when the air was still,
The vapours arose which have strength to kill;
At morn they were seen, at noon they were felt,
At night they were darkness no star could melt.

And unctuous meteors from spray to spray
Crept and flitted in broad noonday
Unseen; every branch on which they alit
By a venomous blight was burned and bit.

The Sensitive Plant, like one forbid,
Wept, and the tears within each lid
Of its folded leaves, which together grew,
Were changed to a blight of frozen glue.

For the leaves soon fell, and the branches soon
By the heavy axe of the blast were hewn;
The sap shrank to the root through every pore
As blood to a heart that will beat no more.

For Winter came: the wind was his whip:
One choppy finger was on his lip:
He had torn the cataracts from the hills
And they clanked at his girdle like manacles;

His breath was a chain which without a sound
The earth, and the air, and the water bound;
He came, fiercely driven, in his chariot-throne
By the tenfold blasts of the Arctic zone.

Then the weeds which were forms of living death
Fled from the frost to the earth beneath.
Their decay and sudden flight from frost
Was but like the vanishing of a ghost!

And under the roots of the Sensitive Plant
The moles and the dormice died for want:
The birds dropped stiff from the frozen air
And were caught in the branches naked and bare.

First there came down a thawing rain
And its dull drops froze on the boughs again;
Then there steamed up a freezing dew
Which to the drops of the thaw-rain grew;

And a northern whirlwind, wandering about
Like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out,
Shook the boughs thus laden, and heavy, and stiff,
And snapped them off with his rigid griff.

When Winter had gone and Spring came back
The Sensitive Plant was a leafless wreck;
But the mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels,
Rose like the dead from their ruined charnels.

<nonum>CONCLUSION.</nonum>

Whether the Sensitive Plant, or that
Which within its boughs like a Spirit sat,
Ere its outward form had known decay,
Now felt this change, I cannot say.

Whether that Lady's gentle mind,
No longer with the form combined
Which scattered love, as stars do light,
Found sadness, where it left delight,

I dare not guess; but in this life
Of error, ignorance, and strife,
Where nothing is, but all things seem,
And we the shadows of the dream,

It is a modest creed, and yet
Pleasant if one considers it,
To own that death itself must be,
Like all the rest, a mockery.

That garden sweet, that lady fair,
And all sweet shapes and odours there,
In truth have never passed away:
'Tis we, 'tis ours, are changed; not they.

For love, and beauty, and delight,
There is no death nor change: their might
Exceeds our organs, which endure
No light, being themselves obscure.

   <firstline>The serpent is shut out from Paradise</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
I
The serpent is shut out from Paradise.
The wounded deer must seek the herb no more
    In which its heart-cure lies:
The widowed dove must cease to haunt a bower
Like that from which its mate with feigned sighs
    Fled in the April hour.
I too must seldom seek again
Near happy friends a mitigated pain.

II
Of hatred I am proud,—with scorn content;
Indifference, that once hurt me, now is grown
    Itself indifferent;
But, not to speak of love, pity alone
Can break a spirit already more than bent.
    The miserable one
Turns the mind’s poison into food,—
Its medicine is tears,—its evil good.

III
Therefore, if now I see you seldomer,
Dear friends, dear <i>friend</i>! know that I only fly
    Your looks, because they stir
Griefs that should sleep, and hopes that cannot die:
The very comfort that they minister
    I scarce can bear, yet I,
So deeply is the arrow gone,
Should quickly perish if it were withdrawn.

IV
When I return to my cold home, you ask
Why I am not as I have ever been.
    <i>You</i> spoil me for the task
Of acting a forced part in life's dull scene,—
Of wearing on my brow the idle mask
    Of author, great or mean,
In the world's carnival. I sought
Peace thus, and but in you I found it not.

V
Full half an hour, to-day, I tried my lot
With various flowers, and every one still said,
    ''She loves me—loves me not.''<!-- TODO: Henvisning til Faust iflg. fotnote i kilden. -->
And if this meant a vision long since fled—
If it meant fortune, fame, or peace of thought—
    If it meant,—but I dread
To speak what you may know too well:
Still there was truth in the sad oracle.

VI
The crane o'er seas and forests seeks her home;
No bird so wild but has its quiet nest,
    When it no more would roam;
The sleepless billows on the ocean’s breast
Break like a bursting heart, and die in foam,
    And thus at length find rest:
Doubtless there is a place of peace
Where MY weak heart and all its throbs will cease.

VII
I asked her, yesterday, if she believed
That I had resolution. One who <i>had</i>
    Would ne’er have thus relieved
His heart with words,—but what his judgement bade
Would do, and leave the scorner unrelieved.
    These verses are too sad
To send to you, but that I know,
Happy yourself, you feel another’s woe.

    <title>Ode to the West Wind</title>
    <firstline>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
<nonum><center>I</center></nonum>

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!


<nonum><center>II</center></nonum>

Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith's height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,
Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear!


<nonum><center>III</center></nonum>

Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams,

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear!


<nonum><center>IV</center></nonum>

If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.


<nonum><center>V</center></nonum>

Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,

Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?

    <firstline>I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers</firstline>

<body>
<poetry>
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
And laugh as I pass in thunder.

I sift the snow on the mountains below,
And their great pines groan aghast;
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,
Lightning my pilot sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
It struggles and howls at fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
This pilot is guiding me,
Lured by the love of the genii that move
In the depths of the purple sea;
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,
Over the lakes and the plains,
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
The Spirit he loves remains;
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,
Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,
And his burning plumes outspread,
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
When the morning star shines dead;
As on the jag of a mountain crag,
Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
An eagle alit one moment may sit
In the light of its golden wings.
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
Its ardours of rest and of love,
And the crimson pall of eve may fall
From the depth of Heaven above,
With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest,
As still as a brooding dove.

That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
Whom mortals call the Moon,
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,
By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
Which only the angels hear,
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
The stars peep behind her and peer;
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
Like a swarm of golden bees,
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,
Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
Are each paved with the moon and these.

I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,
And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
Over a torrent sea,
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,
The mountains its columns be.
The triumphal arch through which I march
With hurricane, fire, and snow,
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,
Is the million-coloured bow;
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,
While the moist Earth was laughing below.

I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when with never a stain
The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
Build up the blue dome of air,
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
I arise and unbuild it again.

<poetry>
I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright:
I arise from dreams of thee,       
And a spirit in my feet
Hath led me—who knows how?
To thy chamber window, Sweet!

The wandering airs they faint
On the dark, the silent stream—       
The Champak odours fail
Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
The nightingale's complaint,
It dies upon her heart;—
As I must on thine,              
Oh, beloved as thou art!

Oh lift me from the grass!
I die! I faint! I fail!
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale.      
My cheek is cold and white, alas!
My heart beats loud and fast;—
Oh! press it to thine own again,
Where it will break at last.

Shall we roam, my love,
To the twilight grove,
When the moon is rising bright;
Oh, I'll whisper there,
In the cool night-air,
What I dare not in broad daylight!

I'll tell thee a part
Of the thoughts that start
To being when thou art nigh;
And thy beauty, more bright
Than the stars' soft light,
Shall seem as a weft from the sky.

When the pale moonbeam
On tower and stream
Sheds a flood of silver sheen,
How I love to gaze
As the cold ray strays
O'er thy face, my heart's throned queen!

Wilt thou roam with me
To the restless sea,
And linger upon the steep,
And list to the flow
Of the waves below
How they toss and roar and leap?

Those boiling waves,
And the storm that raves
At night o'er their foaming crest,
Resemble the strife
That, from earliest life,
The passions have waged in my breast.

Oh, come then, and rove
To the sea or the grove,
When the moon is rising bright;
And I'll whisper there,
In the cool night-air,
What I dare not in broad daylight.

<poetry>
Swiftly walk over the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear, - 
Swift be thy flight!

Wrap thy form in a mantle grey,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day,
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand - 
Come, long-sought!

When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sighed for thee.

Thy brother Death came, and cried
`Wouldst thou me?'
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee
`Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?' -And I replied
`No, not thee!'

Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon - 
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, beloved Night - 
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!

    <title>Stanzas Written in Dejection, near Naples</title>
    <firstline>The sun is warm, the sky is clear</firstline>

<body>
<poetry>
         The sun is warm, the sky is clear, 
         The waves are dancing fast and bright, 
      Blue isles and snowy mountains wear 
      The purple noon's transparent might, 
         The breath of the moist earth is light, 
      Around its unexpanded buds; 
         Like many a voice of one delight, 
      The winds, the birds, the ocean floods, 
The City's voice itself, is soft like Solitude's. 

         I see the Deep's untrampled floor 
         With green and purple seaweeds strown; 
      I see the waves upon the shore, 
      Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown: 
         I sit upon the sands alone,— 
      The lightning of the noontide ocean 
         Is flashing round me, and a tone 
      Arises from its measured motion, 
How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion. 

         Alas! I have nor hope nor health, 
         Nor peace within nor calm around, 
      Nor that content surpassing wealth 
      The sage in meditation found, 
         And walked with inward glory crowned— 
      Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure. 
         Others I see whom these surround— 
      Smiling they live, and call life pleasure; 
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure. 

         Yet now despair itself is mild, 
         Even as the winds and waters are; 
      I could lie down like a tired child, 
      And weep away the life of care 
         Which I have borne and yet must bear, 
      Till death like sleep might steal on me, 
         And I might feel in the warm air 
      My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea 
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony. 

         Some might lament that I were cold, 
         As I, when this sweet day is gone, 
      Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, 
      Insults with this untimely moan; 
         They might lament—for I am one 
      Whom men love not,—and yet regret, 
         Unlike this day, which, when the sun 
      Shall on its stainless glory set, 
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.

<poetry>
They die—the dead return not—Misery
Sits near an open grave and calls them over,
A Youth with hoary hair and haggard eye—
They are the names of kindred, friend and lover,
Which he so feebly calls—they all are gone—
Fond wretch, all dead! those vacant names alone,
This most familiar scene, my pain—
These tombs—alone remain.

Misery, my sweetest friend—oh, weep no more!
Thou wilt not be consoled—I wonder not!
For I have seen thee from thy dwelling’s door
Watch the calm sunset with them, and this spot
Was even as bright and calm, but transitory,
And now thy hopes are gone, thy hair is hoary;
This most familiar scene, my pain—
These tombs—alone remain.

    <title>The Two Spirits. An Allegory</title>
    <firstline>O thou, who plumed with strong desire</firstline>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
<nonum><center><i>First Spirit</i></center></nonum>    

<sc>O thou</sc>, who plumed with strong desire
Wouldst float above the earth, beware!
A Shadow tracks thy flight of fire—
        Night is coming!
Bright are the regions of the air, 
And among the winds and beams
It were delight to wander there—
        Night is coming!


<nonum><center><i>Second Spirit</i></center></nonum>    

The deathless stars are bright above;
If I would cross the shade of night, 
Within my heart is the lamp of love,
        And that is day!
And the moon will smile with gentle light
On my golden plumes where'er they move;
The meteors will linger round my flight, 
        And make night day.


<nonum><center><i>First Spirit</i></center></nonum>    

But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken
Hail, and lightning, and stormy rain;
See, the bounds of the air are shaken—
        Night is coming! 
The red swift clouds of the hurricane
Yon declining sun have overtaken,
The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain—
        Night is coming!


<nonum><center><i>Second Spirit</i></center></nonum>    

I see the light, and I hear the sound; 
I'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark
With the calm within and the light around
    Which makes night day:
And     thou, when the gloom is deep and stark,
Look from thy dull earth, slumber-bound, 
My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark
        On high, far away.

        ---

Some say there is a precipice
Where one vast pine is frozen to ruin
O'er piles of snow and chasms of ice 
        'Mid Alpine mountains;
And that the languid storm pursuing
That winged shape, for ever flies
Round those hoar branches, aye renewing
        Its aery fountains.

Some say when nights are dry and clear,
And the death-dews sleep on the morass,
Sweet whispers are heard by the traveller,
        Which make night day:
And a silver shape like his early love doth pass 
Upborne by her wild and glittering hair,
And when he awakes on the fragrant grass,
        He finds night day.

    <subtitle>An Elegy on the Death of John Keats</subtitle>
    <firstline>I weep for Adonais—he is dead!</firstline>
    <keywords>keats,sidney</keywords>
</head>
<body>
<poetry>
<nonum><center>I</center></nonum>
    I weep for Adonais—he is dead!
    Oh, weep for Adonais! though our tears
    Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!
    And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years
    To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,
    And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With me
    Died Adonais; till the Future dares
    Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
An echo and a light unto eternity!"

<nonum><center>II</center></nonum>
    Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay,
    When thy Son lay, pierc'd by the shaft which flies
    In darkness? where was lorn Urania
    When Adonais died? With veiled eyes,
    'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise
    She sate, while one, with soft enamour'd breath,
    Rekindled all the fading melodies,
    With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,
He had adorn'd and hid the coming bulk of Death.

<nonum><center>III</center></nonum>
    Oh, weep for Adonais—he is dead!
    Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!
    Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed
    Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep
    Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;
    For he is gone, where all things wise and fair
    Descend—oh, dream not that the amorous Deep
    Will yet restore him to the vital air;
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.

<nonum><center>IV</center></nonum>
    Most musical of mourners, weep again!
    Lament anew, Urania! He died,
    Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,
    Blind, old and lonely, when his country's pride,
    The priest, the slave and the liberticide,
    Trampled and mock'd with many a loathed rite
    Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,
    Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light.

<nonum><center>V</center></nonum>
    Most musical of mourners, weep anew!
    Not all to that bright station dar'd to climb;
    And happier they their happiness who knew,
    Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time
    In which suns perish'd; others more sublime,
    Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,
    Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;
    And some yet live, treading the thorny road,
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode.

<nonum><center>VI</center></nonum>
    But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perish'd,
    The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,
    Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherish'd,
    And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;
    Most musical of mourners, weep anew!
    Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last,
    The bloom, whose petals nipp'd before they blew
    Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;
The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast.

<nonum><center>VII</center></nonum>
    To that high Capital, where kingly Death
    Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,
    He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,
    A grave among the eternal.—Come away!
    Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day
    Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still
    He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;
    Awake him not! surely he takes his fill
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.

<nonum><center>VIII</center></nonum>
    He will awake no more, oh, never more!
    Within the twilight chamber spreads apace
    The shadow of white Death, and at the door
    Invisible Corruption waits to trace
    His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;
    The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe
    Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface
    So fair a prey, till darkness and the law
Of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw.

<nonum><center>IX</center></nonum>
    Oh, weep for Adonais! The quick Dreams,
    The passion-winged Ministers of thought,
    Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams
    Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught
    The love which was its music, wander not—
    Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,
    But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot
    Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again.

<nonum><center>X</center></nonum>
    And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,
    And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries,
    "Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;
    See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,
    Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies
    A tear some Dream has loosen'd from his brain."
    Lost Angel of a ruin'd Paradise!
    She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.

<nonum><center>XI</center></nonum>
    One from a lucid urn of starry dew
    Wash'd his light limbs as if embalming them;
    Another clipp'd her profuse locks, and threw
    The wreath upon him, like an anadem,
    Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;
    Another in her wilful grief would break
    Her bow and winged reeds, as if to stem
    A greater loss with one which was more weak;
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek.

<nonum><center>XII</center></nonum>
    Another Splendour on his mouth alit,
    That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath
    Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,
    And pass into the panting heart beneath
    With lightning and with music: the damp death
    Quench'd its caress upon his icy lips;
    And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath
    Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,
<nonum><center>I</center></nonum>t flush'd through his pale limbs, and pass'd to its eclipse.

<nonum><center>XIII</center></nonum>
    And others came . . . Desires and Adorations,
    Winged Persuasions and veil'd Destinies,
    Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations
    Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;
    And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,
    And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam
    Of her own dying smile instead of eyes,
    Came in slow pomp; the moving pomp might seem
<nonum><center>L</center></nonum>ike pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.

<nonum><center>XIV</center></nonum>
    All he had lov'd, and moulded into thought,
    From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,
    Lamented Adonais. Morning sought
    Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,
    Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,
    Dimm'd the aëreal eyes that kindle day;
    Afar the melancholy thunder moan'd,
    Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.

<nonum><center>XV</center></nonum>
    Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,
    And feeds her grief with his remember'd lay,
    And will no more reply to winds or fountains,
    Or amorous birds perch'd on the young green spray,
    Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day;
    Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear
    Than those for whose disdain she pin'd away
    Into a shadow of all sounds: a drear
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear.

<nonum><center>XVI</center></nonum>
    Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down
    Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,
    Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown,
    For whom should she have wak'd the sullen year?
    To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear
    Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both
    Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere
    Amid the faint companions of their youth,
With dew all turn'd to tears; odour, to sighing ruth.

<nonum><center>XVII</center></nonum>
    Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale
    Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;
    Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale
    Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain
    Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,
    Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,
    As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain
    Light on his head who pierc'd thy innocent breast,
And scar'd the angel soul that was its earthly guest!

<nonum><center>XVIII</center></nonum>
    Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,
    But grief returns with the revolving year;
    The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;
    The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;
    Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier;
    The amorous birds now pair in every brake,
    And build their mossy homes in field and brere;
    And the green lizard, and the golden snake,
<nonum><center>L</center></nonum>ike unimprison'd flames, out of their trance awake.

<nonum><center>XIX</center></nonum>
    Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean
    A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst
    As it has ever done, with change and motion,
    From the great morning of the world when first
    God dawn'd on Chaos; in its stream immers'd,
    The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;
    All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;
    Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight,
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might.

<nonum><center>XX</center></nonum>
    The leprous corpse, touch'd by this spirit tender,
    Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;
    Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour
    Is chang'd to fragrance, they illumine death
    And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;
    Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows
    Be as a sword consum'd before the sheath
    By sightless lightning?—the intense atom glows
A moment, then is quench'd in a most cold repose.

<nonum><center>XXI</center></nonum>
    Alas! that all we lov'd of him should be,
    But for our grief, as if it had not been,
    And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!
    Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene
    The actors or spectators? Great and mean
    Meet mass'd in death, who lends what life must borrow.
    As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,
    Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.

<nonum><center>XXII</center></nonum>
    He will awake no more, oh, never more!
    "Wake thou," cried Misery, "childless Mother, rise
    Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,
    A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs."
    And all the Dreams that watch'd Urania's eyes,
    And all the Echoes whom their sister's song
    Had held in holy silence, cried: "Arise!"
    Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.

<nonum><center>XXIII</center></nonum>
    She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs
    Out of the East, and follows wild and drear
    The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,
    Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,
    Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear
    So struck, so rous'd, so rapt Urania;
    So sadden'd round her like an atmosphere
    Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.

<nonum><center>XXIV</center></nonum>
    Out of her secret Paradise she sped,
    Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,
    And human hearts, which to her aery tread
    Yielding not, wounded the invisible
    Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell:
    And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,
    Rent the soft Form they never could repel,
    Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,
Pav'd with eternal flowers that undeserving way.

<nonum><center>XXV</center></nonum>
    In the death-chamber for a moment Death,
    Sham'd by the presence of that living Might,
    Blush'd to annihilation, and the breath
    Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light
    Flash'd through those limbs, so late her dear delight.
    "Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,
    As silent lightning leaves the starless night!
    Leave me not!" cried Urania: her distress
Rous'd Death: Death rose and smil'd, and met her vain caress.

<nonum><center>XXVI</center></nonum>
    "Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;
    Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;
    And in my heartless breast and burning brain
    That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,
    With food of saddest memory kept alive,
    Now thou art dead, as if it were a part
    Of thee, my Adonais! I would give
    All that I am to be as thou now art!
But I am chain'd to Time, and cannot thence depart!

<nonum><center>XXVII</center></nonum>
    "O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,
    Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men
    Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart
    Dare the unpastur'd dragon in his den?
    Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then
    Wisdom the mirror'd shield, or scorn the spear?
    Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when
    Thy spirit should have fill'd its crescent sphere,
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer.

<nonum><center>XXVIII</center></nonum>
    "The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;
    The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;
    The vultures to the conqueror's banner true
    Who feed where Desolation first has fed,
    And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled,
    When, like Apollo, from his golden bow
    The Pythian of the age one arrow sped
    And smil'd! The spoilers tempt no second blow,
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low.

<nonum><center>XXIX</center></nonum>
    "The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;
    He sets, and each ephemeral insect then
    Is gather'd into death without a dawn,
    And the immortal stars awake again;
    So is it in the world of living men:
    A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight
    Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when
    It sinks, the swarms that dimm'd or shar'd its light
<nonum><center>L</center></nonum>eave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night."

<nonum><center>XXX</center></nonum>
    Thus ceas'd she: and the mountain shepherds came,
    Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;
    The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame
    Over his living head like Heaven is bent,
    An early but enduring monument,
    Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song
    In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent
    The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.

<nonum><center>XXXI</center></nonum>
    Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,
    A phantom among men; companionless
    As the last cloud of an expiring storm
    Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,
    Had gaz'd on Nature's naked loveliness,
    Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray
    With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,
    And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,
Pursu'd, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.

<nonum><center>XXXII</center></nonum>
    A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift—
    A Love in desolation mask'd—a Power
    Girt round with weakness—it can scarce uplift
    The weight of the superincumbent hour;
    It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,
    A breaking billow; even whilst we speak
    Is it not broken? On the withering flower
    The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break.

<nonum><center>XXXIII</center></nonum>
    His head was bound with pansies overblown,
    And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;
    And a light spear topp'd with a cypress cone,
    Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew
    Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,
    Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart
    Shook the weak hand that grasp'd it; of that crew
    He came the last, neglected and apart;
A herd-abandon'd deer struck by the hunter's dart.

<nonum><center>XXXIV</center></nonum>
    All stood aloof, and at his partial moan
    Smil'd through their tears; well knew that gentle band
    Who in another's fate now wept his own,
    As in the accents of an unknown land
    He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scann'd
    The Stranger's mien, and murmur'd: "Who art thou?"
    He answer'd not, but with a sudden hand
    Made bare his branded and ensanguin'd brow,
Which was like Cain's or Christ's—oh! that it should be so!

<nonum><center>XXXV</center></nonum>
    What softer voice is hush'd over the dead?
    Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?
    What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,
    In mockery of monumental stone,
    The heavy heart heaving without a moan?
    If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,
    Taught, sooth'd, lov'd, honour'd the departed one,
    Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,
The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.

<nonum><center>XXXVI</center></nonum>
    Our Adonais has drunk poison—oh!
    What deaf and viperous murderer could crown
    Life's early cup with such a draught of woe?
    The nameless worm would now itself disown:
    It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone
    Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong,
    But what was howling in one breast alone,
    Silent with expectation of the song,
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung.

<nonum><center>XXXVII</center></nonum>
    Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!
    Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,
    Thou noteless blot on a remember'd name!
    But be thyself, and know thyself to be!
    And ever at thy season be thou free
    To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow;
    Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;
    Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now.

<nonum><center>XXXVIII</center></nonum>
    Nor let us weep that our delight is fled
    Far from these carrion kites that scream below;
    He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;
    Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now.
    Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow
    Back to the burning fountain whence it came,
    A portion of the Eternal, which must glow
    Through time and change, unquenchably the same,
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.

<nonum><center>XXXIX</center></nonum>
    Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep,
    He hath awaken'd from the dream of life;
    'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep
    With phantoms an unprofitable strife,
    And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife
    Invulnerable nothings. We decay
    Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief
    Convulse us and consume us day by day,
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.

<nonum><center>XL</center></nonum>
    He has outsoar'd the shadow of our night;
    Envy and calumny and hate and pain,
    And that unrest which men miscall delight,
    Can touch him not and torture not again;
    From the contagion of the world's slow stain
    He is secure, and now can never mourn
    A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;
    Nor, when the spirit's self has ceas'd to burn,
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.

<nonum><center>XLI</center></nonum>
    He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he;
    Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young Dawn,
    Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee
    The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;
    Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!
    Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air,
    Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown
    O'er the abandon'd Earth, now leave it bare
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!

<nonum><center>XLII</center></nonum>
    He is made one with Nature: there is heard
    His voice in all her music, from the moan
    Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;
    He is a presence to be felt and known
    In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,
    Spreading itself where'er that Power may move
    Which has withdrawn his being to its own;
    Which wields the world with never-wearied love,
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.

<nonum><center>XLIII</center></nonum>
    He is a portion of the loveliness
    Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear
    His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress
    Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there
    All new successions to the forms they wear;
    Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight
    To its own likeness, as each mass may bear;
    And bursting in its beauty and its might
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light.

<nonum><center>XLIV</center></nonum>
    The splendours of the firmament of time
    May be eclips'd, but are extinguish'd not;
    Like stars to their appointed height they climb,
    And death is a low mist which cannot blot
    The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought
    Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair,
    And love and life contend in it for what
    Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.

<nonum><center>XLV</center></nonum>
    The inheritors of unfulfill'd renown
    Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,
    Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton
    Rose pale, his solemn agony had not
    Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought
    And as he fell and as he liv'd and lov'd
    Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,
    Arose; and Lucan, by his death approv'd:
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprov'd.

<nonum><center>XLVI</center></nonum>
    And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,
    But whose transmitted effluence cannot die
    So long as fire outlives the parent spark,
    Rose, rob'd in dazzling immortality.
    "Thou art become as one of us," they cry,
    "It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long
    Swung blind in unascended majesty,
    Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song.
Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!"

<nonum><center>XLVII</center></nonum>
    Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,
    Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.
    Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;
    As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light
    Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might
    Satiate the void circumference: then shrink
    Even to a point within our day and night;
    And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink
When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd thee to the brink.

<nonum><center>XLVIII</center></nonum>
    Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre,
    Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought
    That ages, empires and religions there
    Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;
    For such as he can lend—they borrow not
    Glory from those who made the world their prey;
    And he is gather'd to the kings of thought
    Who wag'd contention with their time's decay,
And of the past are all that cannot pass away.

<nonum><center>XLIX</center></nonum>
    Go thou to Rome—at once the Paradise,
    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;
    And where its wrecks like shatter'd mountains rise,
    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress
    The bones of Desolation's nakedness
    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;

<nonum><center>L</center></nonum>
    And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time
    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;
    And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,
    Pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd
    This refuge for his memory, doth stand
    Like flame transform'd to marble; and beneath,
    A field is spread, on which a newer band
    Have pitch'd in Heaven's smile their camp of death,
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguish'd breath.

<nonum><center>LI</center></nonum>
    Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet
    To have outgrown the sorrow which consign'd
    Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,
    Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,
    Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find
    Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,
    Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind
    Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?

<nonum><center>LII</center></nonum>
    The One remains, the many change and pass;
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;
    Life, like a dome of many-colour'd glass,
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!
    Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky,
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.

<nonum><center>LIII</center></nonum>
    Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?
    Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here
    They have departed; thou shouldst now depart!
    A light is pass'd from the revolving year,
    And man, and woman; and what still is dear
    Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.
    The soft sky smiles, the low wind whispers near:
    'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,
No more let Life divide what Death can join together.

<nonum><center>LIV</center></nonum>
    That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,
    That Beauty in which all things work and move,
    That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse
    Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love
    Which through the web of being blindly wove
    By man and beast and earth and air and sea,
    Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of
    The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.

<nonum><center>LV</center></nonum>
    The breath whose might I have invok'd in song
    Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven,
    Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng
    Whose sails were never to the tempest given;
    The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!
    I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;
    Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,
    The soul of Adonais, like a star,
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.

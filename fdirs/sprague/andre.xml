<poetry>
    Gay, guiltless pair!	
What seek ye from the fields of heaven?	
  Ye have no need of prayer,	
Ye have no sins to be forgiven.	

    Why perch ye here,
Where mortals to their Maker bend?	
  Can your pure spirits fear	
The God ye never could offend?	

    Ye never knew	
The crimes for which we come to weep;
  Penance is not for you,	
Blest wanderers of the upper deep!	

    To you ’tis given	
To wake sweet Nature’s untaught lays;	
  Beneath the arch of heaven
To chirp away a life of praise.	

    Then spread each wing,	
Far, far above, o’er lakes and lands,	
  And join the choirs that sing	
In yon blue dome not reared with hands;

    Or, if ye stay	
To note the consecrated hour,	
  Teach me the airy way,	
And let me try your envied power!	

    Above the crowd
On upward wings could I but fly,	
  I’d bathe in yon bright cloud,	
And seek the stars that gem the sky.	

    ’Twere heaven indeed,	
Through fields of trackless light to soar,
  On Nature’s charms to feed,	
And Nature’s own great God adore.

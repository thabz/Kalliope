   <title>If Thou Hast Lost a Friend</title>

<sc>If</sc> thou hast lost a friend, 
  By hard or hasty word, 
Go, call him to thy heart again; 
  Let pride no more be heard. 
Remind him of those happy days, 
  Too beautiful to last; 
Ask, if a word should cancel years 
  Of truth and friendship past! 
Oh! if thou'st lost a friend, 
  By hard or hasty word, 
Go, call him to thy heart again; 
Let pride mo more be heard. 

Oh! tell him, from thy thought 
  The light of joy hath fled; 
That, in thy sad and silent breast, 
  Thy lonely heart seems dead; 
That mount and vale, each path ye trod, 
  By morn or evening dim, 
Reproach you with their frowning gaze, 
  And ask your soul for him. 
Then, if thou'st lost a friend, 
  By hard or hasty word, 
Go, call him to thy heart again; 
  Let pride no more be heard.

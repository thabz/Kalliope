Over two shadowless waters, adrift as a pinnace in peril,
     Hangs as in heavy suspense, charged with irresolute light,
Softly the soul of the sunset upholden awhile on the sterile
      Waves and wastes of the land, half repossessed by the night.
Inland glimmer the shallows asleep and afar in the breathless
      Twilight: yonder the depths darken afar and asleep.
Slowly the semblance of death out of heaven descends on the deathless
      Waters: hardly the light lives on the face of the deep — 
Hardly, but here for awhile. All over the grey soft shallow
      Hover the colours and clouds of the twilight, void of a star.
As a bird unfledged is the broad-winged night, whose winglets are callow
      Yet, but soon with their plumes will she cover her brood from afar,
Cover the brood of her worlds that cumber the skies with their blossom
      Thick as the darkness of leaf-shadowed spring is encumbered with flowers.
World upon world is enwound in the bountiful girth of her bosom,
      Warm and lustrous with life lovely to look on as ours.
Still is the sunset adrift as a spirit in doubt that dissembles
      Still with itself, being sick of division and dimmed by dismay — 
Nay, not so; but with love and delight beyond passion it trembles,
      Fearful and fain of the night, lovely with love of the day:
Fain and fearful of rest that is like unto death, and begotten
      Out of the womb of the tomb, born of the seed of the grave:
Lovely with shadows of loves that are only not wholly forgotten,
      Only not wholly suppressed by the dark as a wreck by the wave.
Still there linger the loves of the morning and noon, in a vision
      Blindly beheld, but in vain: ghosts that are tired, and would rest.
But the glories beloved of the night rise all too dense for division,
      Deep in the depth of her breast sheltered as doves in a nest.
Fainter the beams of the loves of the daylight season cnkindled
      Wane, and the memories of hours that were fair with the love of them fade:
Loftier, aloft of the lights of the sunset stricken and dwindled,
      Gather the signs of the love at the heart of the night new-made.
New-made night, new-born of the sunset, immeasurable, endless,
      Opens the secret of love hid from of old in her heart,
In the deep sweet heart full-charged with faultless love of the friendless
      Spirits of men that are eased when the wheels of the sun depart.
Still is the sunset afloat as a ship on the waters upholden
      Full-sailed, wide-winged, poised softly for ever asway — 
Nay, not so, but at least for a little, awhile at the golden
      Limit of arching air fain for an hour to delay.
Here on the bar of the sand-bank, steep yet aslope to the gleaming
      Waste of the water without, waste of the water within,
Lights overhead and lights underneath seem doubtfully dreaming
       Whether the day be done, whether the night may begin.
Far and afar and farther again they falter and hover,
      Warm on the water and deep in the sky and pale on the cloud:
Colder again and slowly remoter, afraid to recover
      Breath, yet fain to revive, as it seems, from the skirt of the shroud.
Faintly the heartbeats shorten and pause of the light in the westward
      Heaven, as eastward quicken the paces of star upon star
Hurried and eager of life as a child that strains to the breast-ward
      Eagerly, yearning forth of the deeps where the ways of them are,
Glad of the glory of the gift of their life and the wealth of its wonder,
      Fain of the night and the sea and the sweet wan face of the earth.
Over them air grows deeper, intense with delight in them: under
      Things are thrilled in their sleep as with sense of a sure new birth.
But here by the sand-bank watching, with eyes on the sea-line, stranger
      Grows to me also the weight of the sea-ridge gazed on of me,
Heavily heaped up, changefully changeless, void though of danger
      Void not of menace, but full of the might of the dense dull sea.
Like as the wave is before me, behind is the bank deep-drifted;
      Yellow and thick as the bank is behind me in front is the wave.
As the wall of a prison imprisoning the mere is the girth of it lifted:
      But the rampire of water in front is erect as the wall of a grave.
And the crests of it crumble and topple and change, but the wall is not broken:
      Standing still dry-shod, I see it as higher than my head,
Moving inland alway again, reared up as in token
      Still of impending wrath still in the foam of it shed.
And even in the pauses between them, dividing the rollers in sunder,
      High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark,
And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder
      Cloud and torrent and storm, darkening the depths of the dark.
Up to the sea, not upon it or over it, upward from under
      Seems he to gaze, whose eyes yearn after it here from the shore:
A wall of turbid water, aslope to the wide sky's wonder
      Of colour and cloud, it climbs, or spreads as a slanted floor.
And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were living,
      Winged and wonderful, beams like as birds are that pass and are free:
But the light is dense as darkness, a gift withheld in the giving,
       That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea.
Stained and stifled and soiled, made earthier than earth is and duller,
      Grimly she puts back light as rejected, a thing put away:
No transparent rapture, a molten music of colour;
      No translucent love taken and given of the day.
Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light's live self on her falling,
      As the light of a man's life lighted the- fume of a dungeon mars:
Only she knows of the wind, when her wrath gives ear to him calling;
      The delight of the light she knows not, nor answers the sun or the stars.
Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving:
      None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her heart.
Yearly she feeds on her dead, yet herself seems dead and not living,
      Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not depart.
In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse is,
      Haply, for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank's fang
And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses
      Whose manes are yellow as plague, and as ensigns of pestilence hang,
That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city;
      So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with sand,
Discoloured, opaque, suspended in sign as of strength without pity,
      That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the strand.
Here, far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens
      Northward, lonely for miles, ere ever a village begin,
On the lapsing land that recedes as the growth of the strong sea strengthens
      Shoreward, thrusting further and further its outworks in,
Here in Shakespeare's vision, a flower of her kin forsaken,
      Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave's edge,
Surely by no shore else, but here on the bank stormshaken,
      Perdita, bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge.
Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her
      Outcast, fair as a fain~, the child of a far-off king:
And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder
      Bowed, compassionate, hoar as the hawthorn blossom in spring,
And kind as harvest in autumn: a shelter of shade on the lonely
      Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves:
Here, where the wind walks royal, alone in his kingdom, and only
      Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and craves.
All these waters and wastes are his empire of old, and awaken
      From barren and stagnant slumber at only the sound of his breath:
Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart, nor the goal overtaken
      That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn after death.
All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation
      Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart, grown heartsick of strife:
Till sometime its wild heart maddens, and moans, and the vast ululation
      Takes wing with the clouds on the waters, and wails to be quit of its life.
For the spirit and soul of the waste is the wind, and his wings with their waving
      Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or thinned;
But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror's insatiably craving
      That victory can fill not, as power cannot satiate the want of the wind.
All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might, and oppose not
      Aught of defence nor of barrier, of forest or precipice piled:
But the will of the wind works ever as his that desires what he knows not,
      And the wail of his want unfulfilled is as one making moan for her child.
And the cry of his triumph is even as the crying of hunger that maddens
      The heart of a strong man aching in vain as the wind's heart aches
And the sadness itself of the land for its infinite solitude saddens
       More for the sound than the silence athirst for the sound that slakes.
And the sunset at last and the twilight are dead: and the darkness is breathless
      With fear of the wind's breath rising that seems and seems not to sleep:
But a sense of the sound of it alway, a spirit unsleeping and deathless,
      Ghost or God, evermore moves on the face of the deep.

   <title>A Ballad of Burdens</title>
   <firstline>The burden of fair women. Vain delight</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
The burden of fair women. Vain delight,
And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,
And sorrowful old age that comes by night
As a thief comes that has no heart by day,
And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey,
And weariness that keeps awake for hire,
And grief that says what pleasure used to say;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,
A burden without fruit in childbearing;
Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,
Threescore between the dawn and evening.
The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering
In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,
Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,
Cover thy head, and weep; for verily
These market-men that buy thy white and brown
In the last days shall take no thought for thee.
In the last days like earth thy face shall be,
Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,
Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear
Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;
And say at night "Would God the day were here,"
And say at dawn "Would God the day were dead."
With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,
And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,
Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see
Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;
And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,
And no more as the thing beforetime seen.
And thou shalt say of mercy "It hath been,"
And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,
And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of sad sayings. In that day
Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell
Thy times and ways and words of love, and say
How one was dear and one desirable,
And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,
But now with lights reverse the old hours retire
And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,
White rain and wind among the tender trees;
A summer of green sorrows gathering,
Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,
With sad face set towards the year, that sees
The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,
And winter wan with many maladies;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of dead faces. Out of sight
And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,
Changed in the changing of the dark and light,
They walk and weep about the barren lands
Where no seed is nor any garner stands,
Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,
And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

The burden of much gladness. Life and lust
Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;
And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,
And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;
And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,
And where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,
And where the day was, the likeness of the night;
This is the end of every man's desire. 

L'ENVOY 

Princes, and ye whom pleasure quickeneth,
Heed well this rhyme before your pleasure tire;
For life is sweet, but after life is death.    
This is the end of every man's desire.

    <title>A Ballad of Dreamland</title>
    <firstline>I hid my heart in a nest of roses</firstline>
</head>
<body>
I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
  Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;
In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is,
  Under the roses I hid my heart.
  Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
  What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
Only the song of a secret bird.

Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,
  And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;
Lie still, for the wind on the warm sea dozes,
  And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
  Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
  What bids the lids of thy sleep dispart?
Only the song of a secret bird.

The green land's name that a charm encloses,
  It never was writ in the traveller's chart,
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,
  It never was sold in the merchant's mart.
  The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;
  No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,
Only the song of a secret bird.

    <title>A Forsaken Garden</title>
    <firstline>In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland</firstline>
</head>
<body>
In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,
  At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee,
Walled round with rocks as an inland island,
  The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.
A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses
  The steep square slope of the blossomless bed
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses
        Now lie dead.

The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,
  To the low last edge of the long lone land.
If a step should sound or a word be spoken,
  Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,
  Through branches and briars if a man make way,
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless
        Night and day.

The dense hard passage is blind and stifled
  That crawls by a track none turn to climb
To the strait waste place that the years have rifled
  Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.
The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;
  The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.
The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,
        These remain.

Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;
  As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,
  Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.
Over the meadows that blossom and wither
  Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;
Only the sun and the rain come hither
        All year long.

The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels
  One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.
Only the wind here hovers and revels
  In a round where life seems barren as death.
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,
  Haply, of lovers none ever will know,
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
        Years ago.

Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither,"
  Did he whisper? "look forth from the flowers to the sea;
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,
  And men that love lightly may die--but we?"
And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,
  And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,
        Love was dead.

Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?
  And were one to the end--but what end who knows?
Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,
  As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?
  What love was ever as deep as a grave?
They are loveless now as the grass above them
        Or the wave.

All are at one now, roses and lovers,
  Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.
Not a breath of the time that has been hovers
  In the air now soft with a summer to be.
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter
  Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,
When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter
        We shall sleep.

Here death may deal not again for ever;
  Here change may come not till all change end.
From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,
  Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.
Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,
  While the sun and the rain live, these shall be;
Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing
        Roll the sea.

Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,
  Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble
  The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,
  Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,
As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,
        Death lies dead.

<body>
Years have risen and fallen in darkness or in twilight,
  Ages waxed and waned that knew not thee nor thine,
While the world sought light by night and sought not thy light,
  Since the sad last pilgrim left thy dark mid shrine.
Dark the shrine and dumb the fount of song thence welling,
  Save for words more sad than tears of blood, that said:
<i>Tell the king, on earth has fallen the glorious dwelling,</i>
  <i>And the watersprings that spake are quenched and dead.</i>
<i>Not a cell is left the God, no roof, no cover</i>
  <i>In his hand the prophet laurel flowers no more.</i>
And the great king's high sad heart, thy true last lover,
  Felt thine answer pierce and cleave it to the core.
      And he bowed down his hopeless head
        In the drift of the wild world's tide,
      And dying, <i>Thou hast conquered</i>, he said,
        <i>Galilean</i>; he said it, and died.
      And the world that was thine and was ours
      When the Graces took hands with the Hours
      Grew cold as a winter wave
      In the wind from a wide-mouthed grave,
      As a gulf wide open to swallow
        The light that the world held dear.
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

Age on age thy mouth was mute, thy face was hidden,
  And the lips and eyes that loved thee blind and dumb;
Song forsook their tongues that held thy name forbidden,
  Light their eyes that saw the strange God's kingdom come.
Fire for light and hell for heaven and psalms for pæans
  Filled the clearest eyes and lips most sweet of song,
When for chant of Greeks the wail of Galileans
  Made the whole world moan with hymns of wrath and wrong.
Yea, not yet we see thee, father, as they saw thee,
  They that worshipped when the world was theirs and thine,
They whose words had power by thine own power to draw thee
  Down from heaven till earth seemed more than heaven divine.
      For the shades are about us that hover
        When darkness is half withdrawn
      And the skirts of the dead night cover
        The face of the live new dawn.
      For the past is not utterly past
      Though the word on its lips be the last,
      And the time be gone by with its creed
      When men were as beasts that bleed,
      As sheep or as swine that wallow,
        In the shambles of faith and of fear.
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

Yet it may be, lord and father, could we know it,
  We that love thee for our darkness shall have light
More than ever prophet hailed of old or poet
  Standing crowned and robed and sovereign in thy sight.
To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee,
  Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew;
Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee,
  Who wast older, O our father, than they knew.
For no thought of man made Gods to love or honour
  Ere the song within the silent soul began,
Nor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her
  Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man.
      And the word and the life wast thou,
        The spirit of man and the breath;
        And before thee the Gods that bow
      Take life at thine hands and death.
      For these are as ghosts that wane,
      That are gone in an age or twain;
      Harsh, merciful, passionate, pure,
      They perish, but thou shalt endure;
      Be their flight with the swan or the swallow,
        They pass as the flight of a year.
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

Thou the word, the light, the life, the breath, the glory,
  Strong to help and heal, to lighten and to slay,
Thine is all the song of man, the world's whole story;
  Not of morning and of evening is thy day.
Old and younger Gods are buried or begotten
  From uprising to downsetting of thy sun,
Risen from eastward, fallen to westward and forgotten,
  And their springs are many, but their end is one.
Divers births of godheads find one death appointed,
  As the soul whence each was born makes room for each;
God by God goes out, discrowned and disanointed,
  But the soul stands fast that gave them shape and speech.
      Is the sun yet cast out of heaven?
        Is the song yet cast out of man?
      Life that had song for its leaven
        To quicken the blood that ran
      Through the veins of the songless years
      More bitter and cold than tears,
      Heaven that had thee for its one
      Light, life, word, witness, O sun,
      Are they soundless and sightless and hollow,
        Without eye, without speech, without ear?
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

Time arose and smote thee silent at his warning,
  Change and darkness fell on men that fell from thee;
Dark thou satest, veiled with light, behind the morning,
  Till the soul of man should lift up eyes and see.
Till the blind mute soul get speech again and eyesight,
  Man may worship not the light of life within;
In his sight the stars whose fires grow dark in thy sight
  Shine as sunbeams on the night of death and sin.
Time again is risen with mightier word of warning,
  Change hath blown again a blast of louder breath;
Clothed with clouds and stars and dreams that melt in morning,
  Lo, the Gods that ruled by grace of sin and death!
      They are conquered, they break, they are stricken,
        Whose might made the whole world pale;
      They are dust that shall rise not or quicken
        Though the world for their death's sake wail.
      As a hound on a wild beast's trace,
      So time has their godhead in chase;
      As wolves when the hunt makes head,
      They are scattered, they fly, they are fled;
      They are fled beyond hail, beyond hollo,
        And the cry of the chase, and the cheer.
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

Day by day thy shadow shines in heaven beholden,
 Even the sun, the shining shadow of thy face:
King, the ways of heaven before thy feet grow golden;
  God, the soul of earth is kindled with thy grace.
In thy lips the speech of man whence Gods were fashioned,
  In thy soul the thought that makes them and unmakes;
By thy light and heat incarnate and impassioned,
  Soul to soul of man gives light for light and takes.
As they knew thy name of old time could we know it,
  Healer called of sickness, slayer invoked of wrong,
Light of eyes that saw thy light, God, king, priest, poet,
  Song should bring thee back to heal us with thy song.
      For thy kingdom is past not away,
        Nor thy power from the place thereof hurled;
      Out of heaven they shall cast not the day,
        They shall cast not out song from the world.
      By the song and the light they give
      We know thy works that they live;
      With the gift thou hast given us of speech
      We praise, we adore, we beseech,
      We arise at thy bidding and follow,
        We cry to thee, answer, appear,
    O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,
        Destroyer and healer, hear!

For a day and a night Love sang to us, played with us,
  Folded us round from the dark and the light;
And our hearts were fulfilled of the music he made with us,
Made with our hearts and our lips while he stayed with us,
  Stayed in mid passage his pinions from flight
        For a day and a night.

From his foes that kept watch with his wings had he hidden us,
  Covered us close from the eyes that would smite,
From the feet that had tracked and the tongues that had chidden us
Sheltering in shade of the myrtles forbidden us
  Spirit and flesh growing one with delight
        For a day and a night.

But his wings will not rest and his feet will not stay for us:
  Morning is here in the joy of its might;
With his breath has he sweetened a night and a day for us;
Now let him pass, and the myrtles make way for us;
  Love can but last in us here at his height
        For a day and a night.

F:Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth
N:6 Wepened = weaponed<br>7 the = thee<br>7 liff = life<br>10 the = thee<br>14 the = thee

Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth,
My great payne, how litle she regardeth.
The holy oth, wherof she taketh no cure 
Broken she hath, and yet she bideth sure
Right at her ease and litle she dredeth. 
Wepened thou art and she unarmed sitteth.
To the disdaynfull her liff she ledeth, 
To me spitefull withoute cause or mesure. 
            Behold love. 
  
I ame in hold: if pitie the meveth, 
Goo bend thy bowe that stony hertes breketh, 
And with some stroke revenge the displeasure
Of thee and him, that sorrowe doeth endure, 
And, as his lorde, the lowly entreateth. 
            Behold love.

T:Yf it be so that I forsake the
F:Yf it be so that I forsake the
N:1 the = thee<br>3 hert = heart<br>12 perdy = par dieu

Yf it be so that I forsake the
As banysshed from thy company, 
Yet my hert, my mynde and myn affection
Shall still remain in thy perfection, 
And right as thou lyst so order me. 
But som would saye in their opinion 
Revoulsed is thy good intention;
Then may I well blame thy cruelte
            Yf it be so. 

But myself I say on this fasshion:
I have her hert in my possession, 
And of it self there cannot, perdy, 
By no meanes love an herteles body; 
And on my faith good is the reason
            If it be so.

Goo, burnyng sighes, Vnto the frosen hert.
Goo breke the Ise which pites paynfull dert 
Myght never perse, and if mortall prayer
In hevyn may be herd, at lest I desire
That deth or mercy be end of my smart.
Take with the payne whereof I have my part
And eke the flame from which I cannot stert 
And leve me then in rest, I you require. 
            Goo, burning sighes.

I must goo worke, I se, by craft and art
For trueth and faith in her is laide apart.
Alas, I cannot therefore assaill her 
With pitefull plaint and scalding fyer 
That oute of my brest doth straynably stert.
            Goo, burning sighes.

To stryve by stedfastnes for to attayne
To be juste and true and fle from dowblenes,
Sythens all alike, where ruleth craftines, 
Rewarded is boeth fals and plain?
Sonest he spedeth, that moost can fain; 
True meanyng hert is had in disdayn. 
Against deceipte and dowblenes 
            What vaileth trouth? 
  
Decyved is he by crafty trayn
That meaneth no gile and doeth remayn 
Within the trapp withoute redresse
But for to love, lo, such a maisteres, 
Whose crueltie nothing can refrayn,

And if that ye have founde it, ye that be here, 
And seke to convaye it secretely, 
Handell it soft and trete it tenderly
Or els it will plain and then appere. 
But rather restore it mannerly
Syns that I do aske it thus honestly,
For to lese it it sitteth me to neere; 
            Helpe me to seke. 

Alas, and is there no remedy
But have I thus lost it wilfully?
I wis it was a thing all to dere 
To be bestowed and wist not where;
It was myn hert, I pray you hertely 
            Helpe me to seke.

Thou hast no faith of him that hath none,

For as saieth a proverbe notable, 
Eche thing seketh his semblable,
And thou hast thyn of thy condition. 
Yet is it not the thing I passe on, 
Nor hote nor cold of myn affection, 
For syns thyn hert is so mutable, 
            Thou hast no faith. 

I thought the true withoute exception,  
But I perceve I lacked discretion 
To fasshion faith to wordes mutable:
Thy thought is to light and variable,
To chaunge so oft withoute occasion, 
            Thou hast no faith.

No man setteth more by riding in your saddell;

Who so tast you shall well perceve your layer
Savoureth som what of a kappurs stable,

Ye must now serve to market and to faire, 
All for the burden, for pannyers a paire; 
For syns gray heres ben powdered in your sable,

To pourchase it by payment and by prayer,

Caesar, when that the traytour of Egipt
    With th'onorable hed did him present,
    Covering his gladness, did represent
    Playnt with his teeres owteward, as it is writt.
And Hannyball eke, when fortune him shitt
    Clene from his reign and from all his intent,
    Laught to his folke whome sorrowe did torment,
    His cruell dispite for to disgorge and qwit.
So chaunceth it oft that every passion
    The mynde hideth by colour contrary
    With fayned visage, now sad, now mery:
Whereby if I laught any tyme or season,
    It is for bicause I have nother way
    To cloke my care but vnder sport and play.

The longe love that in my thought doeth harbar 
    And in myn hert doeth kepe his residence
    Into my face preseth with bold pretence
    And therein campeth, spreding his baner. 
She that me lerneth to love and suffre 
    And will that my trust and lustes negligence 
    Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,
    With his hardines taketh displeasure. 
Wherewithall, vnto the hertes forrest he fleith,
    Leving his entreprise with payne and cry,
    And there him hideth and not appereth.
What may I do when my maister fereth,
    But in the felde with him to lyve and dye?
    For goode is the liff ending faithfully.

To take bred at my hand; and nowe they raunge
Besely seking with a continuell chaunge.

Thancked be fortune it hath ben othrewise
Twenty tymes better, but ons in speciall,
In thyn arraye after a pleasaunt gyse,
When her lose gowne from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her armes long and small,
Therewithall swetely did me kysse,
And softely said "dere hert, howe like you this?"

It was no dreme: I lay brode waking.
But all is torned thorough my gentilnes
Into a straunge fasshion of forsaking;
And I have leve to goo of her goodeness,
And she also to vse new fangilnes.
But syns that I so kyndely ame served,
I would fain knowe what she hath deserved.

<b>The louer sheweth how he is forsaken of such as he somtime enioyed</b>

They flee from me, that somtime did me seke
With naked fote stalkyng within my chamber.
Once haue I seen them gentle, tame, and meke,
That now are wild, and do not once remember
That sometyme they haue put them selues in danger,
To take bread at my hand, and now they range,
Busily sekyng in continuall change.

Thanked be fortune, it hath bene otherwise
Twenty tymes better: but once especiall,
In thinne aray, after a pleasant gyse,
When her loose gowne did from her shoulders fall,
And she me caught in her armes long and small,
And therwithall, so swetely did me kysse,
And softly sayd: deare hart, how like you this?

It was no dreame: for I lay broade awakyng.
But all is turnde now through my gentlenesse.
Into a bitter fashion of forsakyng:
And I haue leaue to go of her goodnesse,
And she also to vse newfanglenesse.
But, sins that I vnkyndly so am serued:
How like you this, what hath she now deserued?

            Blame not my lutte.

My lute and strynges may not deny
But as I strike they must obay;
Brake not them than soo wrongfully,
But wryeke thy selffe some wyser way;
And tho the songes whiche I endight
To qwytt thy chainge with Rightfull spight,
            Blame not my lute.

Spyght askyth spight and changing change
And falsyd faith must nedes be knowne.
The faute so grett, the case so strange,
Of Right it must abrod be blown:
Then sins that by thyn own desartte
My soinges do tell how trew thou artt,
            Blame not my lute.

Blame but thy selffe that hast mysdown
And well desarvid to have blame;
Change thou thy way so evyll bygown
And then my lute shall sownd that same;
But if tyll then my fyngeres play
By thy desartt their wontyd way,
            Blame not my lutte.

Farewell, vnknowne, for tho thow brake
My strynges in spight with grett desdayn
Yet have I fownd owt for thy sake
Stringes for to strynge my lute agayne.
And yf perchance this folysh Ryme
Do make the blush at any tyme
            Blame nott my lutte.

Madame, withouten many wordes,
Ons I am sure ye will or no;
And if ye will then leve your bordes,
And vse your wit and shew it so.

And with a beck ye shall me call;
And if of oon that burneth alwaye
Ye have any pitie at all,
Aunswer him faire with yea or nay.

Yf it be yea, I shalbe fayne;
If it be nay, frendes as before,
Ye shall an othre man obtain,
And I myn owne and yours no more.

What menythe thys when I lye alone?
I tosse, I turne, I syghe, I grone,
My bedd me semys as hard as stone:
        What menys thys?

I syghe, I playne contynually;
The clothes that on my bedd do ly
Always methynks they lye awry:
        What menys thys?

In slumbers oft for fere I quake;
For hete and cold I burne and shake;
For lake of slepe my hede dothe ake;
        What menys thys?

A mornynges then when I do rysse
I torne vnto my wontyd gysse,
All day after muse and devysse:
        What menys thys?

And yff perchanse by me there passe
She vnto whome I sue for grace,
The cold blood forsakythe my face:
        What menythe thys?

But yff I sytte nere her by,
With lowd voyce my hart dothe cry,
And yet my mowthe ys dome and dry:
        What menys thys?

To aske for helpe no hart I have
My tong dothe fayle what I shuld crave,
Yet inwardly I Rage and Rave:
        What menys thys?

Thus have I passyd many a yere,
And many a day, tho nowght Apere
But most of that that most I fere:
        What menys thys?

F:When first mine eyes did view, and marke
N:2 beawtie = beauty<br>12 bene dum = been dumb<br>15 fete = feet<br>geat = get<br>17 eche = each<br>18 sene = seen

When first mine eyes did view, and marke
Thy faire beawtie to beholde:
And when mine eares listned to hark
The pleasant wordes that thou me tolde,
I would as then I had been free
From eares to heare, and eyes to see.

And when my lips gan first to moue,
Wherby my hart to thee was knowne,
And when my tong did talk of loue,
To thee that hast true loue down throwne:
I would my lips, and tong also,
Had then bene dum, no deale to go.

And when my handes haue handled ought
That thee hath kept in memorie,
And when my fete haue gone and sought
To finde and geat thy company,
I would eche hand a foote had bene,
And I eche foote a hand had sene.

And when in mynde I did consent
To folow this my fansies will:
And when my hart did first relent,
To tast such bayt, my life to spyll,
I would my hart had bene as thyne
Or els thy hart had bene as mine.

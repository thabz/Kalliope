Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth,
My great payne, how litle she regardeth.
The holy oth, wherof she taketh no cure
Broken she hath, and yet she bideth sure
Right at her ease and litle she dredeth.
Wepened thou art and she unarmed sitteth.
To the disdaynfull her liff she ledeth,
To me spitefull withoute cause or mesure.
            Behold love.

I ame in hold: if pitie the meveth,
Goo bend thy bowe that stony hertes breketh,
And with some stroke revenge the displeasure
Of thee and him, that sorrowe doeth endure,
And, as his lorde, the lowly entreateth.
            Behold love.

Yf it be so that I forsake the
As banysshed from thy company,
Yet my hert, my mynde and myn affection
Shall still remain in thy perfection,
And right as thou lyst so order me.
But som would saye in their opinion
Revoulsed is thy good intention;
Then may I well blame thy cruelte
            Yf it be so.

But myself I say on this fasshion:
I have her hert in my possession,
And of it self there cannot, perdy,
By no meanes love an herteles body;
And on my faith good is the reason
            If it be so.

Goo, burnyng sighes, Vnto the frosen hert.
Goo breke the Ise which pites paynfull dert
Myght never perse, and if mortall prayer
In hevyn may be herd, at lest I desire
That deth or mercy be end of my smart.
Take with the payne whereof I have my part
And eke the flame from which I cannot stert
And leve me then in rest, I you require.
            Goo, burning sighes.

I must goo worke, I se, by craft and art
For trueth and faith in her is laide apart.
Alas, I cannot therefore assaill her
With pitefull plaint and scalding fyer
That oute of my brest doth straynably stert.

And thou hast thyn of thy condition.
Yet is it not the thing I passe on,
Nor hote nor cold of myn affection,
For syns thyn hert is so mutable,

I thought the true withoute exception,
But I perceve I lacked discretion
To fasshion faith to wordes mutable:

To chaunge so oft withoute occasion,

Caesar, when that the traytour of Egipt
    With th'onorable hed did him present,
    Covering his gladness, did represent
    Playnt with his teeres owteward, as it is writt.
And Hannyball eke, when fortune him shitt
    Clene from his reign and from all his intent,
    Laught to his folke whome sorrowe did torment,
    His cruell dispite for to disgorge and qwit.
So chaunceth it oft that every passion
    The mynde hideth by colour contrary
    With fayned visage, now sad, now mery:
Whereby if I laught any tyme or season,
    It is for bicause I have nother way
    To cloke my care but vnder sport and play.

She that me lerneth to love and suffre

Wherewithall, vnto the hertes forrest he fleith,

Farewell, Love, and all thy lawes for ever;
    Thy bayted hookes shall tangill me no more,
    Senec and Plato call me from thy lore
    To perfaict welth my wit for to endever.
In blynde errour when I did persever,
    Thy sherpe repulce that pricketh ay so sore
    Hath taught me to sett in tryfels no store
    And scape fourth syns libertie is lever.
Therefore, farewell; goo trouble yonger hertes
    And in me clayme no more authoritie;
    With idill yeuth goo vse thy propertie
And theron spend thy many britill dertes:
    For hetherto though I have lost all my tyme,
    Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughes to clyme.

Alas, madame, for stelyng of a kysse
Have I so much your mynd ther offended?
Have I then done so grevously amysse
That by no meanes it may be amended?
Then revenge you, and the next way is this:
An othr kysse shall have my lyffe endid.
For to my mowth the first my hert did suck,
The next shall clene oute of my brest it pluck.

Some tyme I fled the fyre that me brent
By see, by land, by water and by wynd,
And now I folow the coles that be quent
From Dovor to Calais against my mynde.
Lo, how desire is boeth sprang and spent!
And he may se that whilome was so blynde,
And all his labor now he laugh to scorne,
Mashed in the breers that erst was all to torne.

They fle from me that sometyme did me seke
With naked fote stalking in my chambre.
I have sene theim gentill, tame, and meke
That nowe are wyld and do not remembre
That sometyme they put theimself in daunger
To take bred at my hand; and nowe they raunge
Besely seking with a continuell chaunge.

Thancked be fortune it hath ben othrewise
Twenty tymes better, but ons in speciall,
In thyn arraye after a pleasaunt gyse,
When her lose gowne from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her armes long and small,
Therewithall swetely did me kysse,
And softely said "dere hert, howe like you this?"

It was no dreme: I lay brode waking.
But all is torned thorough my gentilnes
Into a straunge fasshion of forsaking;
And I have leve to goo of her goodeness,
And she also to vse new fangilnes.
But syns that I so kyndely ame served,
I would fain knowe what she hath deserved.

---

<b>The louer sheweth how he is forsaken of such as he somtime enioyed</b>

They flee from me, that somtime did me seke
With naked fote stalkyng within my chamber.
Once haue I seen them gentle, tame, and meke,
That now are wild, and do not once remember
That sometyme they haue put them selues in danger,
To take bread at my hand, and now they range,
Busily sekyng in continuall change.

Thanked be fortune, it hath bene otherwise
Twenty tymes better: but once especiall,
In thinne aray, after a pleasant gyse,
When her loose gowne did from her shoulders fall,
And she me caught in her armes long and small,
And therwithall, so swetely did me kysse,
And softly sayd: deare hart, how like you this?

It was no dreame: for I lay broade awakyng.
But all is turnde now through my gentlenesse.
Into a bitter fashion of forsakyng:
And I haue leaue to go of her goodnesse,
And she also to vse newfanglenesse.
But, sins that I vnkyndly so am serued:
How like you this, what hath she now deserued?

Blame not my lute for he must sownd
Of thes or that as liketh me.
For lake of wytt the lutte is bownd
To gyve suche tunes as plesithe me.
Tho my songes be sume what strange
And spekes such words as toche they change,
            Blame not my lutte.

My lutte, alas, doth not ofend
Tho that perfors he must agre
To sownd such teunes as I entend
To sing to them that hereth me;
Then tho my songes be some what plain
And tocheth some that vse to fayn,
            Blame not my lutte.

My lute and strynges may not deny
But as I strike they must obay;
Brake not them than soo wrongfully,
But wryeke thy selffe some wyser way;
And tho the songes whiche I endight
To qwytt thy chainge with Rightfull spight,
            Blame not my lute.

Spyght askyth spight and changing change
And falsyd faith must nedes be knowne.
The faute so grett, the case so strange,
Of Right it must abrod be blown:
Then sins that by thyn own desartte
My soinges do tell how trew thou artt,
            Blame not my lute.

Blame but thy selffe that hast mysdown
And well desarvid to have blame;
Change thou thy way so evyll bygown
And then my lute shall sownd that same;
But if tyll then my fyngeres play
By thy desartt their wontyd way,
            Blame not my lutte.

Farewell, vnknowne, for tho thow brake
My strynges in spight with grett desdayn
Yet have I fownd owt for thy sake
Stringes for to strynge my lute agayne.
And yf perchance this folysh Ryme
Do make the blush at any tyme
            Blame nott my lutte.

And vse your wit and shew it so.

And with a beck ye shall me call;
And if of oon that burneth alwaye

Aunswer him faire with yea or nay.

What menythe thys when I lye alone?
I tosse, I turne, I syghe, I grone,
My bedd me semys as hard as stone:
        What menys thys?

I syghe, I playne contynually;
The clothes that on my bedd do ly
Always methynks they lye awry:

In slumbers oft for fere I quake;
For hete and cold I burne and shake;
For lake of slepe my hede dothe ake;

A mornynges then when I do rysse
I torne vnto my wontyd gysse,
All day after muse and devysse:

And yff perchanse by me there passe
She vnto whome I sue for grace,
The cold blood forsakythe my face:

But yff I sytte nere her by,
With lowd voyce my hart dothe cry,
And yet my mowthe ys dome and dry:
        What menys thys?

To aske for helpe no hart I have
My tong dothe fayle what I shuld crave,
Yet inwardly I Rage and Rave:

Thus have I passyd many a yere,
And many a day, tho nowght Apere
But most of that that most I fere:

When first mine eyes did view, and marke
Thy faire beawtie to beholde:
And when mine eares listned to hark
The pleasant wordes that thou me tolde,
I would as then I had been free
From eares to heare, and eyes to see.

And when my lips gan first to moue,
Wherby my hart to thee was knowne,
And when my tong did talk of loue,
To thee that hast true loue down throwne:
I would my lips, and tong also,
Had then bene dum, no deale to go.

And when my handes haue handled ought
That thee hath kept in memorie,
And when my fete haue gone and sought
To finde and geat thy company,
I would eche hand a foote had bene,
And I eche foote a hand had sene.

And when in mynde I did consent
To folow this my fansies will:
And when my hart did first relent,
To tast such bayt, my life to spyll,
I would my hart had bene as thyne
Or els thy hart had bene as mine.

Ons as me thought fortune me kyst
And bad me aske what I thought best
And I should have it as me list
Therewith to set my hert in rest.

I asked nought but my dere hert
To have for evermore myn owne;
Then at an ende were all my smert,
Then should I nede no more to mone.

Yet for all that a stormy blast
Had overtorned this goodely day
And fortune semed at the last
That to her promes she saide nay.

But like as oon oute of dispere
To soudden hope revived I;
Now fortune sheweth herself so fayer
That I content me wonderly.

My moost desire my hand may reche;
My will is alwaye at my hand;
Me nede not long for to beseche
Her that hath power me to commaund.

What erthely thing more can I crave?
What would I wisshe more at my will?
No thing on erth more would I have
Save, that I have, to have it still.

For fortune hath kept her promes
In graunting me my moost desire:
Of my sufferaunce I have redres
And I content me with my hiere.

And end that I have now begon;

As lede to grave in marbill stone,

Should we then sigh, or syng, or mone?
No, no, my lute, for I have done.

The Rokkes do not so cruelly
Repulse the waves continuelly
As she my suyte and affection,
So that I ame past remedy,
Whereby my lute and I have done.

Prowd of the spoyll that thou hast gott
Of simple hertes thorough loves shot,
By whome, vnkynd, thou hast theim wone,
Thinck not he haith his bow forgot,
All tho my lute and I have done.

Vengeaunce shall fall on thy disdain
That makest but game on ernest pain;
Thinck not alone vnder the sonne
Vnquyt to cause thy lovers plain,
All tho my lute and I have done

Perchaunce the lye wethered and old,
The wynter nyghtes that are so cold,
Playnyng in vain vnto the mone;
Thy wisshes then dare not be told;
Care then who lyst, for I have done.

And then may chaunce the to repent
The tyme that thou hast lost and spent,
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoune;
Then shalt thou knowe beaultie but lent
And wisshe and want as I have done.

Now cesse, my lute; this is the last
Labour that thou and I shall wast,
And ended is that we begon;
Now is this song boeth sung and past;
My lute, be still, for I have done.
